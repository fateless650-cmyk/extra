# Chapter 1 (Birth of an Anomaly)

The world is not as simple as it seems. Beneath the surface of everyday life, forces beyond human comprehension wage an eternal struggle—one to maintain balance, the other to shatter it.

### 

At the heart of this conflict are two supernatural entities: *Calamities* and *Demons*.

Calamities are guardians of balance, ensuring that the world does not spiral out of control. To mortals, they are forces of destruction—earthquakes, famines, plagues. But their purpose is not cruelty; it is necessity. They cleanse, they reset, they preserve the cycle of life. Some among them govern fundamental laws—fire burns, gravity pulls, water douses flames. These legendary Calamities are spoken of in myths, their names etched into history as the unseen hands guiding existence.

Then there are the Demons—harbingers of chaos, embodiments of the seven sins: wrath, sloth, gluttony, pride, lust, greed, and envy. Unlike Calamities, they do not seek balance; they seek indulgence. By spreading corruption, they twist mortals to their will, thriving on the discord they sow. The more chaos they create, the stronger they become.

Locked in an endless battle, these two forces shape the world in ways unseen by ordinary humans. And yet, fate has a way of throwing the unexpected into the grand design.

### 

The night was eerily silent, as if the world itself was holding its breath. A storm brewed in the distance, crackling thunder illuminating the dark sky, yet not a single soul stirred in the empty valley. In the midst of this stillness, a small woven basket lay abandoned near the roots of an ancient, towering tree—its bark radiating an otherworldly glow.

Inside the basket, wrapped in simple cloth, was a newborn child. He was unnaturally still, his tiny chest motionless. There was no sound—no crying, no breathing. Just the cold hush of death. His skin was pale, his features delicate, but there was an eerie sense of incompleteness. It was as if the world had already cast him aside, denying him existence.

Then, without warning, the heavens roared.

A crack of lightning split the sky, followed by a voice—a decree, ancient and undeniable. It was not in any language known to man, yet it carried absolute authority. The earth trembled, the towering tree shuddered, and the wind howled as if in defiance. And then…

The child gasped.

His tiny chest rose, then fell. Air rushed into his lungs for the first time, his heart pounded with newfound life. His once-pale skin flushed with warmth, and his fingers twitched as if grasping at something unseen. The very laws that had sought to erase him had now been rewritten.

The decree had changed everything.

A shadowed figure, concealed beneath a tattered cloak, stepped forward from the darkness. Their gaze lingered on the revived infant, their expression unreadable. Then, after a long pause, they reached down and lifted the child into their arms.

A storm raged in the distance, but here, beneath the great ancient tree, the winds settled. The world had tried to erase this child, yet he remained. A nameless anomaly, bound by neither fate nor destiny.

### 

Calamities had their own society, divided much like human civilizations of old—commoners and nobility. Each noble house was known for its legacy, mastering different aspects of power. Some tamed great beasts, some crafted weapons infused with divine energy, others specialized in runes and ancient symbols capable of reshaping reality itself. Strength dictated status, and only the powerful could demand respect.

At the age of twelve, every Calamity-born child underwent an *Awakening Ritual. A small piece of bark from the **Primordial Tree*, the remnants of the first great being—the progenitor of both Calamities and Demons—was given to them. This bark, infused with ancient power, unlocked their dormant abilities, revealing their potential.

For nobles, this was a grand event, a moment to solidify their place in society. Their expectations were sky-high. Commoners, on the other hand, had little to hope for—most had weak or insignificant awakenings, barely enough to make a mark.

# Chapter 10(Instinct Unleashed)

The world slowed.

Kael felt his heart hammering in his chest, each beat sending a pulse of heat through his veins. His vision sharpened, his senses expanded—he could hear the gasps of the crowd, the faint shifting of dirt beneath his feet, even the subtle creak of Varian’s stance adjusting.

But the pain… it was gone.

The crushing gravity, the bruises, the exhaustion—they were still there, but distant, like a dull echo of something that no longer mattered. His body no longer resisted the weight pressing down on him. Instead, it adjusted, adapted, moved as if it belonged in this battle.

This feeling…

It wasn’t just an adrenaline rush. It was deeper than that, primal and ancient, as if something buried in his very core had stirred awake.

Varian was watching him carefully now, his sharp gaze no longer carrying condescension or irritation—only interest. He could feel it too.

Kael exhaled slowly, his fingers tightening into fists.

Then Varian attacked.

A burst of force shattered the ground as he lunged forward, his movements faster, more controlled. His fist shot toward Kael’s ribs, backed by reinforced earth and gravity.

Kael moved before he could think.

He twisted at just the right angle, letting the strike graze past him by the thinnest margin. His body reacted before his mind could question it, flowing like water around Varian’s assault.

And then, he countered.

Kael’s fist crashed into Varian’s side, slipping between his guard with pinpoint precision. It wasn’t the strongest hit, but it was clean. Calculated. Perfect.

Varian barely had time to recover before Kael struck again—this time, a sharp elbow driving into his shoulder. The older noble staggered back, his control faltering for the briefest moment.

Kael didn’t hesitate.

He followed the feeling—the same nagging instinct that had guided him through his relentless training, the unseen force that always pushed him to correct himself, to move better, to fight smarter.

His feet adjusted before the ground could shift beneath him. His strikes landed in the precise spots where Varian’s guard was weakest. His breathing synced with the rhythm of the battle, his body responding like it had fought a thousand fights before this one.

The crowd watched in stunned silence. Kael was pushing Varian back.

Varian gritted his teeth and raised both hands. The ground beneath him exploded, jagged rock rising like a living force, attempting to trap Kael. At the same time, the gravity around him tripled, an invisible hand seeking to crush him.

For a split second, Kael’s vision blurred. The weight bore down, his limbs slowed—but then, something clicked.

He adjusted.

He shifted his stance just a fraction, his body tilting at the perfect angle to counterbalance the increased pull. He felt the force pressing against him, but rather than resist, he let it flow through him, moving with it instead of against it.

His body wasn’t fighting gravity.

It was using it.

With a single step, Kael exploded forward, tearing through the weight like it was nothing. The shift was so sudden that Varian’s eyes widened in shock—just before Kael’s fist slammed into his jaw.

A loud crack echoed across the arena.

Varian staggered back, his control over the battlefield crumbling. The gravity weakened, the stone prison fell apart.

Kael stood tall, breath steady, gaze locked onto his opponent.

The fight wasn’t over.

But for the first time, Varian looked at him not as an opponent to crush—

But as an equal.

A tense silence settled over the training grounds.

Varian exhaled sharply, rolling his shoulders as he steadied himself. His jaw ached where Kael’s fist had connected, and his footing still wavered slightly from the unexpected impact. He wasn’t angry—he was exhilarated.

Kael, on the other hand, stood still, his chest rising and falling in measured breaths. The burning sensation inside him had dulled, but his body still hummed with an energy he didn’t quite understand. The crowd’s murmurs barely registered in his ears, their shocked whispers blending into meaningless noise.

Varian smirked, rubbing his jaw. “You really are something else.”

Kael didn’t respond. He didn’t know what to say.

Then, before either of them could take another step—

“That’s enough.”

Master Orlin’s voice rang out, firm and unyielding.

The atmosphere shifted instantly. The weight of authority in his tone cut through the tension like a blade, freezing both fighters in place. Orlin stepped forward, his sharp gaze sweeping over them both.

“That fight was on the verge of losing control,” he said, his voice even, but carrying an unmistakable edge of command. “Had I waited any longer, someone would have been seriously injured.”

Neither Kael nor Varian spoke.

Orlin sighed, shaking his head. “You two have proven your strength, but discipline is just as important as skill. This spar is over.”

With a wave of his hand, the remnants of cracked stone and disturbed earth settled, the battlefield returning to a semblance of normalcy.

The silence that followed didn’t last long.

The crowd, no longer held back by the intensity of the fight, erupted into a frenzy of whispers and speculation.

“Did you see that? Kael actually held his own against Varian!”
“He did more than that—he pushed him back! How is that even possible?”
“But he’s a failure. He didn’t awaken anything, right?”
“Maybe we were wrong about him…”

The murmurs spread like wildfire, some voices filled with awe, others with disbelief. Even the instructors standing at the edges of the training grounds exchanged glances, their expressions ranging from intrigue to deep contemplation.

Kael clenched his fists, his body still tingling from the fight. He didn’t know how to feel. Was this… victory? It didn’t feel like one. The nagging feeling in his chest told him he was still far from his peak.

Varian chuckled, breaking through his thoughts. “Well, this is going to cause a stir.” He tilted his head toward the audience, where students and teachers alike were still buzzing with energy. “Looks like you’ve become the center of attention.”

Kael exhaled, glancing around. Indeed, all eyes were on him now.

And not with the usual mockery or pity.

This time, they looked at him with something else entirely—uncertainty.

For the first time since his failed awakening, no one knew what to make of him.

And that uncertainty would spread.

By nightfall, rumors would run rampant. By morning, the noble houses would hear of this. By the end of the week, Kael’s name would be spoken in places it had never been before.

What had been meant as a simple spar had become something far more significant.

Kael sighed.

He had no idea what was coming next.

But one thing was certain—his days in obscurity were over.

# Chapter 11 – Whispers of the Duel

The aftermath of the duel between Kael and Varian sent ripples throughout the academy and beyond.

At first, it was mere murmurs—students exchanging stunned glances, recounting the battle in hushed voices. But soon, those murmurs grew into full-blown discussions, then arguments, then outright debates. The spectacle had been too astonishing to ignore.

A commoner, standing toe-to-toe with a noble.

And not just any noble—**Varian Dainvaar**, a prodigy among his house, the holder of a **legendary talent**. His combat prowess was leagues above others, a fact that had been proven time and again.

And yet… Kael had **pushed him back**.

---

### **Academy Grounds – Student Discussion**

"He should have lost."

"But he didn’t."

"Did you see the way he moved? He was predicting Varian’s attacks like he’d been fighting for years."

"No, that wasn’t just prediction. He was reacting at the last possible moment, like his body knew what to do before his mind did."

"You mean… like an instinctual fighter?"

"Exactly! But that doesn’t make sense. He’s never been formally trained."

A noble from House Vaelstrom scoffed. "Please, you’re all exaggerating. The fight ended before either of them could win."

"But that’s the point," a commoner countered. "Master Orlin had to stop them. If he hadn’t, who knows what would’ve happened?"

"Exactly," another student murmured. "The fact that a teacher had to step in means Kael wasn’t losing. It means Varian wasn’t winning either."

"But Varian holds a **legendary talent**!"

"And yet… a so-called failure stood against him."

That last statement lingered in the air, sinking into the minds of every noble who heard it.

"Still, it’s not like he awakened a power."

"Yet."

That one word sent a chill through the nobles in the conversation.

Yet.

Was Kael an anomaly? A freak who somehow fought on par with a noble through sheer determination? Or was there something else lurking beneath the surface?

No one knew for sure. But speculation spread like wildfire.

---

### 

### **The Noble Houses React**

In the grand halls of House Veyrath, lightning crackled faintly in the air as a group of students discussed the match.

“I still can’t believe it,” muttered *Seyrin Veyrath*, his fingers tapping against the wooden table. “Varian was supposed to overwhelm him. Yet, that commoner—” his voice twisted in disbelief, “—was keeping up.”

Another noble scoffed. “Keeping up? He was countering Varian’s attacks like he could predict them.”

A *Nyxir* noble, his dark cloak blending into the candlelit shadows, leaned forward. “No winner was decided, and yet… Kael walked away as if he had gained something. Varian looked—” he hesitated, searching for the right word, “—unsettled.”

At the House Solmara estate, a group of elder nobles discussed the match with more measured tones.

“The match was stopped before it reached its peak,” *Lord Solmara* said, his golden eyes contemplative. “That boy, Kael… he adapted to Varian’s strength mid-fight.”

A younger noble scoffed. “But Varian is a legendary talent. No matter how strong Kael seemed, there’s no way—”

“You misunderstand,” Lord Solmara interrupted, voice carrying the weight of experience. “Strength alone does not make a warrior formidable. *Adaptability* does.”

### **The Commoners’ Buzz**

Meanwhile, in the lesser quarters of the academy, the commoner students were abuzz with excitement.

“That was insane! He was dodging like he could see the attacks coming!”

“I heard he didn’t even awaken properly… How does someone fight like that without powers?”

“Maybe he’s been hiding his strength all along?”

Some were in awe, others skeptical. But all agreed on one thing—Kael was no longer just another nameless student.

### **The Dainvaar House – Rhovan’s Rage**

Back at the grand estate of *House Dainvaar*, frustration boiled in one of its halls.

*Rhovan Dainvaar* paced furiously before his father, *Harvek Dainvaar*, his jaw tight with rage.

“I want to put him back in his place,” Rhovan growled. “That commoner dares to stand on equal footing with a Dainvaar?”

Harvek watched his son with a calculating gaze, fingers steepled before him. “Tell me, Rhovan… what did you see in that fight?”

Rhovan scowled. “I saw a mistake that should have been crushed.”

Harvek’s lips curled slightly. “Then you are blind.”

Rhovan stiffened.

“The match was stopped before its true conclusion,” Harvek continued, his tone cool. “Varian did not lose. But neither did he win.”

Rhovan clenched his fists. “Then we should deal with him now before he becomes a problem.”

Harvek chuckled. “A problem? No. I see a potential *asset*.” He leaned forward, his gaze sharp. “A fighter who adapts, who grows stronger mid-battle, and who challenges even a legendary talent? That is not someone to crush needlessly.”

Rhovan gritted his teeth but remained silent.

Harvek exhaled, his eyes gleaming with interest. “We will watch him. And when the time is right…” He leaned back, smiling. “Perhaps he will join us.”

Rhovan, however, felt nothing but disgust.

Join us? A commoner?

His father’s words echoed in his head like a festering wound.

He could still see it—the way that wretched Kael had stood there, unbowed, unbroken. The whispers among the nobility, the murmurs of admiration from even the lowest peasants. They spoke of Kael as if he were **someone**, as if he were worthy of being compared to Varian, to the great houses.

It was **insulting**.

He would not allow it.

Rhovan straightened, schooling his features into neutrality. “Of course, Father. I understand.”

Harvek raised an eyebrow at the sudden compliance but said nothing.

Rhovan bowed respectfully and turned on his heel, exiting the chamber with slow, deliberate steps.

The moment he was past the grand doors, his face twisted into a snarl.

He stormed down the hallway, fists clenched at his sides. His father might be willing to let Kael run free, but he wasn’t.

That *thing* was a threat. And threats needed to be dealt with.

Rhovan’s steps carried him deeper into the estate, past the grand halls and toward the lower quarters. Past the pristine rooms of nobles and into the more discreet areas, where shadows stretched long, and whispers carried weight.

He stopped at a door, rapping his knuckles against the wood twice.

It creaked open a moment later, revealing a man draped in dark robes, his face obscured by a thin veil of cloth.

Rhovan stepped inside without hesitation. “I have a job for you.”

The man chuckled, a low, rasping sound. “How unfortunate for the one in your sights.”

Rhovan’s eyes burned with barely contained rage. “There’s a boy. A commoner who needs to be… *taught his place*.”

The man leaned against the wall, intrigued. “Ah. The one who stood against young Varian?”

Rhovan’s jaw tightened. Even **here**, in the darkest corners of the estate, the name Kael carried weight.

“Are you going to ask questions, or are you going to do your job?”

The man smirked behind his veil. “Relax, young master. I don’t need to know details.” He paused. “Just tell me… do you want him broken?”

Rhovan didn’t hesitate. “I want him ruined.”

The man’s grin widened. “Consider it done.”

As Rhovan turned to leave, a twisted sense of satisfaction curled in his chest.

His father might be content to *wait*.

But Rhovan wasn’t.

--- Chapter 12 – Unwanted Attention 1c97553b55e780989e7dd9831d3b6226.md ---

# Chapter 12 – Unwanted Attention

Kael had never been one to seek attention.

Yet, ever since his duel with Varian, eyes followed him wherever he went.

He felt them in the hallways, in the classrooms, in the training grounds. Nobles scrutinized him with barely concealed suspicion, commoners with something between admiration and disbelief. Everywhere he went, murmurs trailed behind him like a shadow.

*"Is that him?"*

*"I heard he fought Varian to a standstill.""He’s just a commoner… right?"*

At first, he ignored it.

He was used to being observed—whether it was in scorn before his awakening or curiosity now. People’s opinions didn’t change his reality.

But it was the sheer **volume** of it that became irritating.

Students he had never spoken to suddenly wanted to strike up conversations. Some approached him with exaggerated friendliness, their motives as transparent as glass. Others challenged him outright, eager to test themselves against the so-called "commoner who fought a noble."

At one point, a group of nobles attempted to corner him in the training grounds.

Kael had sent them limping away in less than a minute.

Word spread quickly. The foolish ones learned their lesson.

Despite the storm of attention, Kael refused to let it disrupt his life.

He attended his classes as usual, sparred whenever he could, and trained with the same relentless drive that had defined him long before anyone cared who he was.

Yet, not all interactions were unwanted.

Some approached him not out of curiosity, but genuine interest. **Aeron** and Kaelen were one of them.

The academy’s training grounds were always filled with the sounds of sparring—steel clashing, bodies hitting the ground, the occasional crackle of unleashed elemental power. Today was no different.

Kael leaned against a wooden post, arms crossed, watching as **Kaelen Vaelstrom** and **Aeron Veyrath** squared off in the center of the ring.

Aeron’s stance was relaxed, a confident smirk playing on his lips. Lightning crackled faintly around his arms, arcs of electricity snapping at the air. The wind around him stirred subtly, making his golden hair shift slightly.

Kaelen, by contrast, was utterly still. A thin layer of frost coated his fingers, and a light mist curled around his feet. Unlike Aeron, whose power flickered wildly, Kaelen’s energy was **controlled**, precise.

The moment the signal was given, they moved.

Aeron struck first, a blur of motion as he closed the distance. His fist lashed out, coated in sparks. Kaelen pivoted at the last moment, the frost around his fingers solidifying into a thin blade of ice. He swiped at Aeron’s ribs, but Aeron twisted, wind carrying him just out of reach.

"Close," Aeron chuckled, stepping back.

Kaelen didn’t respond. Instead, he raised a hand—water condensed from the air, forming several sharp shards of ice. With a flick of his wrist, they shot forward.

Aeron didn’t dodge.

Instead, he **disappeared**.

A sudden burst of wind carried him to the side at unnatural speed, the shards shattering against empty space. Lightning crackled in the air as he reappeared, already in motion. His foot slammed down—**boom**—a shockwave of electricity spread outward.

Kaelen reacted instantly, a wall of water rising from the ground. The electricity met it, but instead of dispersing, the current **traveled through the water**—straight toward Kaelen.

Aeron grinned. "Bad move."

Kaelen’s eyes narrowed. The moment before the lightning reached him, the water **froze solid**—trapping the current and leaving a jagged wall of ice standing between them.

Aeron blinked. "Okay, that’s just cheating."

Kaelen exhaled, his breath visible in the sudden cold. "You rely too much on speed. You move before you think."

Aeron snorted. "And you think too much before you move."

Kaelen narrowed his eyes slightly, but there was no hostility—just mutual understanding.

Kael, watching from the sidelines, finally spoke. "So… are you two done flirting, or should I come back later?"

Aeron smirked. "Jealous?"

Kael rolled his eyes. "You wish."

Kaelen let the ice wall shatter, the temperature around them returning to normal. "You’re next."

Kael stepped into the ring. "Then let’s get started."

Aeron cracked his knuckles. "You sure about this?"

Kael rolled his shoulders. "Two-on-one? I thought this would be fun."

Kaelen exhaled sharply. "Try not to embarrass yourself."

Aeron smirked. "I think he means ‘don’t die.’ But yeah, that too."

There was no need for an official signal.

Aeron moved first—**predictably aggressive**. A flash of lightning, and he was suddenly on Kael’s left, a crackling fist aiming for his ribs. Kael twisted, his arm coming up to block—**but Kaelen was already in motion**.

A blast of **freezing mist** curled around Kael’s feet, locking him in place for half a second—just long enough for Aeron’s follow-up kick to slam into his side.

Kael **absorbed the blow**, skidding back but staying upright.

He grinned. "That it?"

Kaelen narrowed his eyes and raised his hand. A fine mist spread across the air—then **froze instantly**, forming countless ice needles hovering in midair.

Kael’s instincts screamed.

**Move. Now.**

The first needle shot forward. Kael ducked—only for **Aeron** to appear behind him, wind-enhanced speed closing the gap. A knee came up—**Kael barely managed to block**, but the force sent him staggering forward—right into **Kaelen’s trap**.

The ice needles **exploded toward him**.

Kael moved on instinct. He twisted, leaning back at the last possible moment. The needles **whistled past him**, missing by mere inches. One grazed his cheek, drawing a thin line of blood.

But Kael wasn’t done.

As his feet touched the ground, he **launched forward**.

His speed caught them both off guard. Kael closed the gap with Kaelen first, slipping past the next barrage of ice and throwing a palm strike at his gut.

Kaelen barely had time to raise a shield of water—**Kael’s fist punched straight through it**, dispersing the barrier and forcing Kaelen to retreat.

Aeron came at him from the side, lightning surging through his arms. Kael twisted, catching the strike and redirecting it—sending Aeron stumbling forward.

For the first time, Aeron looked **surprised**.

Kaelen recovered fast, sending a blast of ice to **lock Kael’s movement** again. But this time, Kael **anticipated it**. He jumped just before the frost reached his feet, flipping over Kaelen and landing behind him.

His arm snapped forward—**a strike aimed at the back of Kaelen’s head**.

But Aeron was faster.

A shockwave of wind **blasted Kael back**, sending him rolling across the ground. He dug his fingers into the dirt, stopping himself just in time to see Aeron and Kaelen regrouping.

Kael wiped the blood from his lip, breathing hard.

Then he grinned. "That’s more like it."

Aeron smirked, rolling his shoulders. "Damn, you’re annoying."

Kaelen exhaled. "He adapts too fast."

Aeron cracked his neck. "Then we hit him harder."

Kael stood up, fists clenched.

**This was fun.**

He readied himself, instincts buzzing with excitement.

The air was electric with tension. The watching students whispered among themselves, eyes locked onto the three fighters.

Kael exhaled slowly. His muscles burned, but his mind was clear. **He was learning.**

Aeron and Kaelen exchanged a glance—silent understanding passing between them.

Then they moved.

Aeron **vanished in a blur**, wind propelling him forward. At the same time, Kaelen raised his hands—**a wall of ice** forming behind Kael, cutting off his retreat.

Kael’s instincts screamed. **A pincer attack.**

He ducked low just as Aeron’s crackling fist came **blasting** toward his head. The punch whizzed past his ear, sending static rippling through his hair. Kael twisted—**aiming a counterpunch at Aeron’s ribs**—but Kaelen was already responding.

A pillar of ice **shot up from the ground**, forcing Kael to leap sideways. But as he landed, **Aeron was there again**, his movements sharper, more precise.

**Fast. Too fast.**

Kael barely managed to parry the first strike, then the second—his arms absorbing most of the impact. **But he wasn’t getting anywhere.**

**Think.**

Aeron was the spear—quick, aggressive, relentless.

Kaelen was the shield—controlling the field, creating openings for Aeron to exploit.

Kael needed to disrupt them. **Now.**

Aeron lunged forward, a wind-enhanced strike aimed at Kael’s torso.

Kael **didn’t dodge.**

Instead, he **stepped into the attack**, absorbing the blow while grabbing Aeron’s forearm. His grip was like iron. Aeron’s eyes widened in shock—

**Kael yanked him forward.**

At the same moment, **Kaelen launched a barrage of ice spikes**—but Kael twisted, **using Aeron as a shield**. The spikes hit **Aeron’s back instead**, making him wince.

Kael didn’t waste a second. With **inhuman strength**, he swung Aeron like a ragdoll and **hurled him straight at Kaelen**.

Kaelen barely had time to react before **Aeron’s body slammed into him**, sending them both tumbling backward.

**Kael moved.**

In an instant, he was **above them**, his fist raised. His entire body **coiled like a spring**—then **exploded downward**.

**BAM!**

His punch struck the ground between them, unleashing a **shockwave** that cracked the earth. The force **sent Aeron and Kaelen flying**, their bodies skidding across the dirt before coming to a rough stop.

Silence.

Then—

The watching students **erupted into chaos**.

"Did you see that?!"

"He just—he just tossed Aeron like nothing!"

"What the hell is he?!"

Kael straightened, rolling his shoulders. His knuckles ached.

Across from him, Aeron groaned, pushing himself up with a dazed expression. Kaelen sat up next to him, shaking his head in disbelief.

Kael smirked. "Still want to hit me harder?"

Aeron huffed out a laugh, shaking off the dirt. "Okay… that was impressive."

Kaelen wiped his face, glaring at Kael. "I hate you."

Kael chuckled. "I’ll take that as a compliment."

Aeron grinned, stretching his arms. "Alright, I admit it—fighting you is a pain in the ass. But…" He cracked his knuckles. "We’re not done yet."

Kael smirked. "Good. Because neither am I."

The tension **lingered**, but now, there was something different.

**Respect.**

For the first time, **Kael wasn’t just an outsider in the academy.**

He was someone they had to acknowledge.

And this… was just the beginning.

# Chapter 13 – A New Normal

The training grounds still buzzed with energy, the echoes of their earlier matches lingering in the air. Groups of students lingered, whispering, casting occasional glances at Kael.

It was nothing new. **They were still talking.**

Kael ignored them.

"You should get used to it," Aeron said, leaning against a nearby training post as Kael finished another sparring match. "The attention, I mean."

Kael exhaled, rubbing his wrist. “I don’t care about attention.”

Aeron smirked. “Clearly.”

Kael rolled his shoulders. “If people want to talk, let them. I don’t have time for nonsense.”

Aeron crossed his arms. "Still, having allies isn’t a bad thing. You may not want to be in the spotlight, but you’re in it now. Might as well make use of it."

Kael didn’t respond immediately. He wasn’t sure how he felt about that statement.

Before he could dwell on it, another figure approached.

**Kaelen.**

“You hit too hard,” Kaelen grumbled, rubbing his ribs. “I thought we were just sparring, not trying to break each other.”

Kael gave him a flat look. “You challenged me.”

Kaelen huffed. “Yeah, yeah. Still, you could at least pretend you’re human. I swear, every time we fight, you react like—” He hesitated, then shrugged. “Like you already know what’s coming.”

Kael didn’t answer.

Because he did.

That nagging feeling again—the same one from his fight with Varian. The more he fought, the sharper it became. His body moved before his mind fully registered the attacks, as if something deep within him was recognizing patterns and adapting at an unnatural speed.

It wasn’t something he could explain. So he didn’t try.

Instead, he glanced between Aeron and Kaelen.

For so long, he had fought alone, trained alone, endured alone.

But now… this was different.

For the first time in a long while, he wasn’t just surviving in the academy.

He was **living** in it.

---

The three of them left the training grounds together, their bodies aching but their spirits high. The sun was beginning to set, casting long shadows across the academy grounds.

“So,” Aeron said, stretching his arms behind his head, “how does it feel?”

Kael raised an eyebrow. “What?”

Aeron smirked. “Winning. Again. I mean, seriously, you just fought both of us at the same time and still walked away without a scratch.”

Kaelen sighed. “Don’t remind me.”

Kael shook his head. “It wasn’t a real fight.”

Aeron chuckled. “Could’ve fooled me. If that wasn’t a real fight, I don’t wanna know what happens when you actually go all out.”

Kaelen shot him a look. “Yeah, no thanks. I like my ribs intact.”

Kael shrugged, unfazed.

The casual conversation felt strange. Not unwelcome, just… **unfamiliar**.

For years, he had been the outcast. The target of whispers, glares, and mockery. **Now, people were talking to him, not just about him.**

A part of him was wary. Things like this didn’t last. People’s opinions changed like the wind.

But for now?

For now, he didn’t mind.

---

Unbeknownst to them, **not all eyes held admiration**.

In the distance, hidden in the academy’s corridors, a pair of figures observed Kael carefully.

One of them—the same shadowed figure Rhovan Dainvaar had met—tilted his head slightly. "Interesting."

Beside him, a noble sneered. "He’s getting too comfortable."

The shadowed figure chuckled. "That won’t last."

The noble’s eyes glinted with cold amusement.

"Let’s see how well he fights when the battle isn’t fair."

Meanwhile

After walking together for a while, their conversation naturally faded into a comfortable silence. As they reached a fork in the academy pathways, Aeron stretched his arms behind his head and exhaled.

“Well, that was a productive day,” he said. “I’ll see you both tomorrow.”

Kaelen waved lazily. “Yeah, yeah. Try not to be late for class this time.”

Aeron smirked. “No promises.” With that, he turned down a different path, disappearing among the academy buildings.

Kaelen lingered a moment longer, glancing at Kael. “You heading back to the orphanage?”

Kael gave a short nod.

Kaelen hesitated, as if debating whether to say something else, but in the end, he just sighed. “Alright. Just… be careful, yeah?”

Kael raised an eyebrow. “Why?”

Kaelen looked around, lowering his voice slightly. “You’ve drawn a lot of attention lately. Not just from students—others are watching too.”

Kael’s expression remained unreadable. “I know.”

Kaelen let out a short laugh. “Of course you do.” He shook his head. “Fine, I won’t nag. Just don’t get yourself into any unnecessary trouble.”

Without waiting for a reply, he turned and walked away, leaving Kael alone.

With a final glance at the academy grounds, Kael continued toward the orphanage.

---

The streets leading to the orphanage were quieter than usual. Most students had already returned to their dorms, and the few commoners still out were either closing shop or hurrying home. The dimming sunlight stretched long shadows across the road.

Kael kept his pace steady, but his senses sharpened. **Something felt off.**

As he turned a corner, he saw them.

**A group of seniors—Academy graduates, standing in the street ahead.**

Most of them bore the crest of House **Dainvaar**.

Kael’s steps slowed instinctively.

**Dainvaar.**

Even before his awakening, that name had always been a problem for him. Their influence ran deep within the academy, and their younger members had made a habit of ensuring Kael knew his place.

Now, with him suddenly standing out, their attention had shifted from casual disdain to something more... deliberate.

The tallest among them, a young man with piercing gray eyes, stepped forward. His uniform was immaculately kept, his posture radiating confidence.

Kael recognized him immediately.

**Ravon Dainvaar. One of the strongest seniors in the academy and… Rhovan’s elder brother.**

The tension in the air was palpable. The other seniors weren’t just bystanders—they were positioned deliberately, subtly blocking the street.

“We have been wanting to meet you my dear junior” said Ravon with a cheeky grin on his face.

Kael’s instincts flared.

**This wasn’t a coincidence.**

# Chapter 14 – The Weight of Arrogance

The group of seniors stood in a loose semicircle around Kael, their presence heavy with an air of superiority. Their uniforms were pristine, their postures relaxed yet imposing—men who had never truly faced adversity, yet carried themselves as if they were the ones who ruled the academy.

Ravon Dainvaar stepped forward, his gray eyes gleaming with condescension. "Kael, wasn't it?" He tilted his head slightly, as if inspecting something beneath his notice. "We've been meaning to have a chat with you."

Kael said nothing. He had no patience for whatever this was.

Ravon smirked at his silence. "You see, there are… *rules* in society. Unspoken understandings. The strong lead, and the weak follow. That’s how things have always been."

Another senior, a broad-shouldered young man with a House Dainvaar insignia pinned to his chest, chuckled. "And yet, lately, you’ve been walking around like you belong among the strong."

Kael exhaled through his nose. "If you have something to say, say it. Otherwise, I have better things to do."

A low murmur of amusement rippled through the group. Another noble, his expression filled with fake sympathy, stepped closer. "Ah, but that’s exactly the problem, Kael. It seems you don’t quite understand your *place*."

Kael narrowed his eyes. "My place?"

"Yes," Ravon continued, as if speaking to a particularly slow child. "You were a nobody. A failure. But now, suddenly, people are talking about you. You’ve forgotten where you stand."

Kael crossed his arms. "And you’re here to remind me?"

Ravon’s smirk widened. "Exactly. Consider this a… *lesson* in understanding your limits."

Kael rolled his shoulders, already bored. "I’m not interested in your lessons."

He turned to leave.

A hand clamped onto his shoulder.

"That’s rude," one of the seniors sneered. "Ignoring your seniors like that? You need to learn some **discipline.**"

Kael’s body tensed instinctively.

Before he could react, another senior moved in from the side and shoved him roughly.

Kael stumbled slightly but didn’t fall. His head tilted downward, his breath steady.

Another shove.

Then another.

The seniors chuckled as if this was all a harmless joke.

"See? This is what happens when you don’t listen," Ravon said mockingly. "You get—"

Kael moved.

Fast.

Before Ravon could react, Kael’s hand snapped out, gripping the wrist of the nearest senior **like a vice.**

The laughter stopped.

The senior's smirk twitched, but he tried to shake Kael off. "Let go, commoner."

Kael’s grip only tightened.

His golden eyes lifted, meeting the senior’s gaze with a cold, unwavering stare.

"You should reconsider what you’re about to do." His voice was calm. Deceptively so.

The pressure in his grip increased—just enough for the noble’s face to twitch in pain.

For the first time, **uncertainty** crept into their expressions.

The sound of **a bone shifting under pressure** snapped through the air like a crack of thunder. The senior gritted his teeth, but the moment Kael gave a sharp twist, a **shrill scream** escaped him.

Kael didn’t even blink. “That’s it?” he said, voice calm but cutting. “All that big talk, and you squeal like a kicked dog?”

The senior dropped to a knee, clutching his arm as Kael finally let go. The mocking glint in Kael’s eyes made it worse.

“Maybe Ravon should invest in better pets,” Kael added coldly.

That was the final straw. The other two commoner seniors, both taller and broader than Kael, surged forward with loud curses and tightened fists.

“You little—” one of them snarled, swinging wide with a punch aimed straight for Kael’s head.

Kael didn’t move at first. He just tilted his neck slightly, that same ever-present glint in his eyes—a glint that always came just before pain.

At the last second, he dipped under the punch, his body flowing like water, and **drove an elbow** straight into the attacker’s gut. The senior doubled over instantly, air whooshing out of him like a deflated bag.

Kael grabbed the back of his head and casually **slammed it into his knee.**

Thud.

The second attacker hesitated. Just for a second. But Kael was already in motion.

He stepped forward, deflecting a hurried strike and retaliating with a sharp, twisting kick to the knee that sent the man **sprawling sideways**, yelping in pain.

Two down.

The first one still lay groaning on the ground, cradling his arm.

Only Ravon remained standing—his amused, arrogant mask cracking at the edges.

And behind him, still leaning against a tree with arms folded, was the fifth senior. Unlike the others, he hadn’t moved. Hadn’t spoken. He just watched.

His eyes hadn’t left Kael once.

Something about his gaze—cool, calculating—put Kael on edge.

But Kael didn’t show it. He rolled his wrist, flexing his knuckles. “Ravon,” he said flatly. “That’s three of yours down. You still want to play shepherd?”

Ravon’s nostrils flared. “They were sloppy. I expected better.”

Kael smirked. “So did I. You might need to replace your dogs.”

The silence hung, thick with tension. The only sounds were the pained groans of Ravon’s underlings.

Behind Ravon, the quiet senior tilted his head ever so slightly. Still saying nothing. Still not moving.

Kael’s gaze flicked to him briefly. He didn’t like how still the man was. Not passive. **Patient.** Like a blade waiting to be drawn.

But for now, Kael’s attention stayed on Ravon.

Because this wasn’t over.

Not yet.

Kael exhaled, his boots grinding against the dirt as he pivoted toward **Ravon**—eyes locked, teeth clenched, knuckles tense. The smug veneer on Ravon’s face was gone now, replaced with something much closer to **panic**.

Kael could see the fear. The hesitation. The reality of the situation sinking in.

And so could Ravon.

Kael pushed forward like a beast off its chain, but just before he reached his target, Ravon snapped his fingers and barked, “**Hold him!**”

The three battered seniors—still recovering, still sore—lunged forward with whatever strength they had left, catching Kael mid-charge. One clung to his right arm, another grabbed his waist, and the last wrapped around his leg like a vice.

“Get off—!” Kael snarled, thrashing violently. He threw his weight against them, feet digging into the earth, muscles straining.

But three bodies at once—even in their state—were enough to slow him. Enough to pin him for just a moment.

And a moment was all Ravon needed.

A flick of the wrist. A glint of **metal** over his knuckles.

Then—**thud.**

The punch drove into Kael’s stomach like a hammer into stone. His breath caught. The air left his lungs in a sharp grunt, his body folding slightly forward as pain spiked through his core.

Ravon grinned, swagger returning with every second Kael stayed down.

“See?” he sneered, stepping closer. “You’ve got strength, sure. But strength alone doesn’t win wars. You think this world is fair? That you’ll rise just because you’re talented?”

He crouched slightly, eyes gleaming with arrogance again. “You’re just another stray mutt trying to run with wolves. But you don’t belong with us.”

Kael, still doubled over, said nothing.

But his fingers curled into fists.

His eyes flicked up.

And Ravon missed it. Too busy monologuing.

“Dainvaar built this world,” Ravon continued, pacing slowly, waving his arms like a performer. “We set the rules. Common trash like you don’t get to rewrite them. You should feel honored just being allowed to breathe the same air as us.”

Then Kael stood up.

Still quiet. Still breathing heavy. But now, his gaze burned.

He moved.

Fast.

The first senior holding his waist took a sudden elbow to the nose. Cartilage crunched. The second, gripping his arm, received a brutal headbutt that sent him reeling. The third tried to tighten his grip, but Kael spun and drove his knee straight into the man’s ribs, sending him to the dirt coughing blood.

Ravon barely had time to react.

Kael was on him in a blink.

**Crack.**

A fist caught Ravon square on the cheek.

**Another.** This time to the jaw. A tooth flew out. He staggered.

**Another.** To the ribs. Ravon gasped.

Kael didn’t stop.

“Where’s all that talk now?” he growled, landing blow after blow. “You done preaching, Ravon?”

Ravon stumbled back, blood smearing down his face. “Y-You’ll regret this…!” he spat. “I’ll make sure you vanish! You hear me? I’ll crush everything you—”

Kael silenced him with a clean right hook that knocked Ravon to the ground.

He stepped over the beaten noble, breathing hard, voice low but steady.

“Then you’d better bring an army.”

And he kept walking.

# Chapter 15 (Target Marked)

Kael didn’t spare another glance at the bloodied heap behind him. He turned, fists still clenched, chest rising and falling as adrenaline throbbed through his veins. With measured steps, he began walking back toward the orphanage path, the fight behind him, the dusk ahead.

But one presence still lingered.

The last senior.

The quiet one.

Still leaning against the low wall, arms crossed, face unreadable.

Kael passed him without a word. Not because he was afraid. But because **the man hadn’t raised a hand**—and until he did, he wasn’t an enemy.

But the silence cracked.

"You're just going to ignore me too?" the senior muttered, clearly irritated, tone dry and deliberate.

Kael stopped. He didn’t turn fully, just glanced back over his shoulder. “You didn’t attack me. So you’re not worth my attention.”

That made the senior click his tongue. “Heh. Not worth it, huh?” He stepped away from the wall, standing fully now, his presence oddly grounded—not aggressive, but unsettlingly composed.

“I’m not sure if that’s arrogant… or smart,” he continued.

Kael finally turned around. “It’s just facts. I fight those who pick one.”

For a second, the senior stared at him, surprised by the answer. He blinked once, processing, then gave a small chuckle. “You’re sharper than you look.”

Kael narrowed his eyes. “Then talk straight. What do you want?”

The senior nodded slightly. “Impressed. That’s what I am. You handled those three like a beast, and then **flattened** a noble. That doesn’t happen often. Not here. Not without consequences.”

Kael said nothing.

The senior continued. “Name’s not important. But I represent a group… let’s just say, we’re not fans of the nobility either. In fact, we’re working toward removing them. One piece at a time.”

Kael’s brow twitched. “What group?”

The senior smirked. “Can’t say. Not yet.”

Kael crossed his arms. “Then we’re done.”

“Maybe,” the man replied. “But we’re watching. And if you survive long enough… you’ll hear from us again.”

Kael turned his back once more. “Then make sure you don’t waste my time when you do.”

And with that, he walked off—leaving behind the bruised ground, the broken egos, and the nameless observer who now saw Kael as **something more than a misfit**.

As Kael disappeared down the path, the senior gave one last glance toward Ravon’s battered form, then whispered to himself with a thin smile—

“Interesting.”

Kael had barely taken five more steps when the voice called out again.

"Wait."

His boots stopped mid-step.

He exhaled sharply through his nose, clearly irritated now. “You really want to push your luck?”

The senior's tone had shifted—cool, but now with a hint of steel underneath. “I figured I should be honest before we start.”

Kael turned, jaw tight, eyes narrowed.

The man met Kael’s gaze, unfazed. “Ravon hired me. Said you needed to be taught a lesson. I was supposed to step in when things got rough.”

Kael’s jaw flexed. “A lesson?”

The senior gave a cold smile, one that didn’t reach his eyes. “Not just a lesson. He wanted you **broken**. Not bruised—**crippled**. Said it with that smug little laugh of his. He wanted you crawling back to your orphanage on shattered knees. One hand crushed, so you'd never land a punch again. Said if your pride didn’t die today, your body should.”

Kael’s expression didn’t change, but his fists tightened.

The senior continued, voice low and matter-of-fact. “He was *very* specific. No visible scars. Damage the joints, crush the muscle from within, slow internal ruptures. That way, no one would even know why you stopped progressing. The perfect silent failure.”

A long silence followed. Heavy.

Then Kael spoke, his voice like steel dragged across stone. “And you were fine with that?”

The man shrugged. “I’ve done worse for less. Ravon pays well, and I don’t care for academy politics. But…”

He looked Kael up and down.

“You weren’t what I expected. Thought I’d be dealing with some arrogant brute who needed humbling. Instead, I saw someone who doesn’t fold, who fights smart—and **hard**. So yeah, I held back. Figured maybe you could be useful.”

Kael’s eyes were like ice now, cold and unreadable.

“And now?”

The senior's tone sharpened. “Now, you’re a liability. I can’t risk you going to the instructors or connecting the dots. Ravon might be scum, but he's a noble scum. If he goes down, he’ll make sure the rest of us burn with him.”

Kael exhaled slowly, his voice controlled. “So you're just another coward wearing a cause like a badge.”

The senior gave a short laugh. “Maybe. But I’m still standing. Let’s see if you are after this.”

Kael’s eyes stayed locked on the man, muscles coiled, mind calculating.

The senior finally straightened his posture, rolling his neck with a soft *pop*. His tone was calm—eerily calm, like the eye of a storm that had been waiting to tear loose.

“You’ve earned something,” he said, taking a step forward, the air around him beginning to thrum.

Kael didn’t respond.

The man gave a faint smile. “My name. I don’t usually give it to the people I’m about to kill.”

He paused, letting the silence stretch, then added with deliberate clarity—

**“Vanesh.”**

Kael’s gaze sharpened.

The man’s smile deepened, laced with something unspoken. “Remember it, if you somehow survive.”

Then his stance shifted—no longer passive, no longer observing.

But ready.

Predatory.

--- Chapter 16 – The Smile Before the Storm 1cc7553b55e780abb5abec0a3a97d390.md ---

# Chapter 16 – The Smile Before the Storm

The name Vanesh lingered in the air like smoke from a dying fire—sharp, bitter, impossible to ignore.

Kael’s eyes narrowed.

There was no need for words anymore.

The courtyard held its breath. Cicadas screeched in the distance, high and shrill, like war drums played by ghosts. Leaves rustled once, then stilled. Even the wind seemed to step aside.

Vanesh stepped forward.

A single step—measured. Silent.

Kael mirrored him. Shoulders loose. Fists half-raised. His gaze tracked the flex of Vanesh’s ankles, the subtle lean in his hips, the faint tremor in his stance that gave away intention.

They circled.

No audience. No applause. Just two figures under fading twilight, both sharpened by survival and silence.

Then—Vanesh struck.

A flicker. A blur.

Kael barely moved in time, jerking his head to the side as a palm cut through the space where it had been. Not a heavy blow—just a tester. A reading.

Kael answered with a low sweep.

Vanesh hopped back, not out of surprise but with precision, as if he'd *expected* the exact counter. He smiled faintly.

“Reflexes. Clean. You're not just brawn after all.”

Kael didn’t answer. His fist shot forward, sharp and quick—only for Vanesh to parry it with the edge of his palm, redirecting the strike with a dancer’s grace.

*Tap.*

Vanesh’s fingers grazed Kael’s wrist as he twisted.

A flash of heat rushed through Kael’s arm.

Kael instinctively recoiled, taking three steps back, eyes narrowing at the sensation. It wasn’t pain. Not yet. But something had shifted.

Vanesh tilted his head. “Feel that? Just a taste of *rupture*. You’ll understand soon.”

Kael flexed his fingers. They felt... heavier.

Tinged with pressure.

“What did you do?” he asked, his voice low.

Vanesh rolled his shoulders, that same relaxed composure in place. “I introduced your nerves to the idea of betrayal.”

Kael’s jaw clenched.

He didn’t wait.

He moved forward this time—faster.

A straight punch, blocked.

A low kick, dodged.

Another blow, intercepted.

Vanesh met each attack like water meets stone—yielding just enough to absorb, never breaking. His limbs moved with unnatural grace, like he wasn’t bound by the same physics.

But Kael could feel it—*Vanesh wasn’t playing at full strength yet.*

And that only meant one thing.

He didn’t think he needed to.

Kael shot forward like a coiled spring, his movements raw and brutal—powered by instinct, sharpened by countless brawls, and driven by a silent fury.

He struck with a hook—fast.

Vanesh leaned just an inch to the left, dodging it effortlessly.

Kael spun mid-motion, driving an elbow toward Vanesh’s temple. Vanesh raised his forearm, absorbing the hit with a muffled *thud*.

Then he mimicked.

Same elbow, 

Same angle, 

Same momentum

*But faster*.

Kael barely blocked in time, stumbling back a half-step. His arms throbbed from the impact.

Vanesh didn’t pause. He flowed into a roundhouse kick—an exact replica of one Kael had used earlier on Ravon.

Kael ducked under it, heart pounding now, mind racing.

He wasn’t just being *fought*—he was being *studied*, *mirrored*, *outclassed.*

“You’re good,” Vanesh said, casually. “Not refined. But very... raw. Pure instinct.”

Kael didn’t answer. He couldn’t waste breath. He surged forward again, fists blurring in a furious barrage—left, right, uppercut, feint, elbow, knee.

Every strike aimed to break rhythm. To force a mistake.

But Vanesh made none.

He parried each blow like it was routine, like Kael’s effort was part of some training drill he’d done a thousand times. He moved not with speed alone, but with an unnatural *fluidity*. Every time Kael struck, Vanesh matched him—*same motion, same technique*, but executed better.

“You learn on the fly,” Vanesh remarked, dodging a jab and copying the same one a split-second later—landing it squarely on Kael’s ribs.

Kael staggered.

Pain flared. His breath hitched.

But he pushed through it.

Clenched his fists. Charged again.

His instincts screamed at him to change rhythm—so he did. He stopped thinking. Let his body take over.

A low feint.

A reverse jab.

Sudden shift in footing—followed by a crushing blow aimed at Vanesh’s jaw.

It was beautiful.

Deadly.

Precise.

And it *almost* landed.

But Vanesh… copied it. Again.

Perfectly.

His own counter-jab met Kael’s just before impact. The two fists collided, but it was Vanesh’s that pushed through, just a fraction stronger, a fraction faster—striking Kael clean across the cheek.

Kael spun from the blow, blood from a split lip flying as he skidded back.

His knees bent slightly. Breathing heavier now. Sweat lining his brow.

Vanesh hadn’t broken a sweat.

Kael’s lungs burned. His muscles felt like they were starting to betray him.

And yet—Vanesh’s face still held that calm, borderline amused expression.

“You’re like a wild wolf,” Vanesh said, voice even. “Cornered. Desperate. And *brilliantly unpredictable.* But I’m not another mutt, Kael.”

His eyes gleamed cold.

“I’m the one who hunts them.”

Kael didn’t flinch.

But the weight in his chest was getting harder to ignore.

Vanesh wasn’t just keeping up—he was *making a statement*.

A living reminder that even someone like Kael—freakish strength, sharp instincts, hardened body—could still be treated like a child against someone truly trained.

The gap wasn’t just talent.

It was *mastery.*

--- Chapter 17 The Edge of Despair 1ce7553b55e780838c0deab4cdde1091.md ---

# Chapter 17: The Edge of Despair

Kael's breaths were ragged, sweat tracing furious lines down his face. His muscles screamed with fatigue, his knuckles raw from impact. Across from him, Vanesh stood like a statue—unruffled, untouchable.

Every strike Kael had launched had been matched with mirrored perfection. Every feint was read like a children’s book. Vanesh wasn’t just keeping up—he was toying with him.

Kael lunged again, pouring every ounce of instinct into his movement. But just as his fist neared Vanesh’s chest, a sharp shift twisted his opponent’s torso, letting the blow slide by harmlessly.

And then came the counter.

Vanesh’s palm struck Kael’s shoulder, precise and fluid, sending him staggering.

Kael gritted his teeth and attacked again.

And again.

And again.

Each time, Vanesh responded with eerie synchronicity—matching pace, technique, even rhythm. He wasn’t just fighting Kael.

He was *mirroring* him.

Kael reeled back, chest heaving, fury and confusion mixing in his blood. “What the hell are you...?”

Vanesh finally spoke, voice low and bored. “You’re getting slow. Is that all?”

Kael didn’t answer. Couldn’t.

Vanesh exhaled and dropped his arms casually to the sides. “You’ve got talent, Kael. Instincts sharper than most. A body made for battle. But unfortunately…”

His tone shifted—cold and final.

“…this fight ended the moment it began.”

Then, almost lazily, he raised a hand.

Kael tensed, body screaming for action.

Too late.

**Crack—!**

A sound like snapping bones echoed in the air. Kael's body jerked violently. His abdomen felt like it had exploded from within.

Then another.

And another.

It wasn’t an external attack.

It was *inside* him.

Kael fell to one knee, choking back vomit, eyes wide in disbelief. “W-what… what did you…”

Vanesh crouched before him, face calm, voice detached. “They’re called rupture points. Tiny charges of spiritual force I implanted on your pressure nodes while we fought.”

Kael’s blood ran cold.

“You thought I was matching your moves because I *needed* to?” Vanesh smiled faintly. “No. I was dancing while laying traps. Dozens of them. On your joints. Nerves. Organs.”

He tapped Kael’s forehead lightly.

“You’ve been bleeding strength this whole time.”

Kael coughed, and this time, blood came with it.

“You bastard…”

Vanesh stood again, brushing dust off his sleeves. “Rupture. My affinity. It lets me store destructive potential in contact points and trigger it remotely. Took years to refine the technique. Ravon only paid for pain. But I’m an artist.”

Kael’s body trembled. The pain was deep—coiling through his core, gnawing at bone and flesh. He could feel it now: the ruptures, like seeds of chaos waiting to bloom.

This was it.

He was going to die.

The world felt smaller—his vision dimming, limbs failing. And yet, somewhere beneath the despair…

…there was *something*.

A hunger.

**That hunger.**

The same bottomless, clawing need he’d felt his whole life. Now it roared awake like a beast unchained.

Kael gritted his teeth, tears stinging his eyes—not from pain, but from fury.

“I’m not done…” he rasped.

Vanesh turned back, raising an eyebrow. “Still breathing? I’ll fix that.”

But Kael wasn’t hearing anymore.

He wasn’t even seeing.

He was falling.

**Inward.**

---

Somewhere deep inside him, the void stretched out like a starless ocean. A place that didn’t obey logic or time. Within that expanse, the hunger thrived—a storm of need and power.

Kael reached for it—not out of choice, but necessity.

And it answered.

The world cracked.

---

Outside, Vanesh stepped forward—and paused.

A strange sound, like the air warping, whispered across the clearing.

Kael stood again.

No… *rose*.

His body, bloodied and broken, now radiated a faint blue hue. Subtle but unmistakable. A shimmer danced along his skin, like space itself bent around him.

Vanesh narrowed his eyes. “What the hell…”

Kael didn’t speak.

But he *moved*.

One step—then two. And with the third, he vanished.

Vanesh pivoted instantly, feeling the pressure shift. Kael reappeared to his flank, fist already mid-swing.

Vanesh blocked, but something was different.

**Piercing force.**

Kael’s fist dug past the guard, like it phased through resistance itself, landing squarely on Vanesh’s ribs.

Vanesh staggered back. *That* one hurt.

The shimmer around Kael pulsed again.

His power unawakened in name, but now whispering through his blood. His awareness stretched beyond sight—he *felt* Vanesh’s position, his movements, even his intentions.

His body, despite the pain, now moved with unnatural grace.

Not perfect.

Not mastered.

But enough.

Enough to fight.

Enough to live.

Kael took a deep breath, the hunger in his gut roaring louder with every heartbeat.

This was just the beginning.

# Chapter - 18 (Cracks in the Dance)

Kael’s breath was steady now.

Not calm.

**Controlled.**

Every nerve screamed. Every wound throbbed. But his mind—sharpened by instinct and that eerie blue shimmer—cut through the pain like a blade through silk.

He didn't need to see Vanesh anymore.

He could *feel* him. Like a ripple in space. A shift in gravity.

Vanesh stood still, one hand on his ribs, brow furrowed—not from pain, but curiosity.

“That hit…” he muttered, rotating his arm. “You bypassed my guard.”

Kael didn’t answer.

He lunged forward instead.

This time, his strike wasn’t pure force—it was *intent.*

He twisted mid-air, feinting high, then pivoted low, his fist aiming for Vanesh’s knee.

Vanesh dodged.

Barely.

Kael adjusted again. Another feint. Another pivot.

**Each strike was precise. Calculated. Sharp.**

The space around Kael hummed with tension, as if resisting movement itself. His awareness danced beyond the physical—reading Vanesh’s shifts before they happened.

He wasn’t *faster*.

He was just a half-step ahead.

Vanesh blocked again, then stepped back. The smirk that once curled his lips had vanished. “So… you *do* have potential.”

Kael didn’t let up. He pressed forward, moving like a storm barely contained. Every punch forced Vanesh to defend, not deflect. Every step claimed ground.

Then, in a rare flash—**contact.**

His palm grazed Vanesh’s jaw.

Not much.

But it drew blood.

A bead rolled down the noble’s chin.

The arena fell silent.

Vanesh touched it, looked at the crimson smear, and smiled—not mocking this time, but wide, feral.

“You’ve become interesting.”

Kael paused, chest heaving. That blue shimmer still wrapped him, but thinner now. He was burning through it.

Fast.

Vanesh raised his hand—and this time, Kael noticed it. A faint glow, almost imperceptible, coiling around his fingers like threads of light.

“Oh… right,” Vanesh said, as if remembering something minor. “You’re still alive.”

Kael’s body tensed.

“Let’s fix that.”

**BOOM—**

Kael barely saw the punch.

It came from nowhere—too fast, too clean. It cracked across his face, sending him skidding backward like a broken ragdoll. He coughed hard, blue shimmer flickering erratically.

Vanesh wasn’t mirroring anymore.

He was *attacking.*

Kael forced himself up, only to meet another blow to his ribs—**rupture power** backing it now.

His body twisted, the force exploding from within.

**Crack—**

His leg buckled. Another rupture point—delayed and timed.

Vanesh’s voice cut through the haze, calm and clinical. “You thought I stopped planting rupture bombs? You’re mistaken. I adapted to your rhythm. Your instincts."

Kael growled, but another rupture flared in his back, staggering him.

Vanesh’s smile faded again—his voice serious now. “This power of yours… it’s no joke. That awareness, that instinct—it’s the kind that lets you survive gods.”

He stepped forward.

“But survival isn’t victory.”

Kael collapsed to one knee. The blue hue still shimmered—barely.

His breaths were short. His hunger surged again—gnawing, desperate.

**Not enough.**

Not enough to win.

But he’d already tasted the edge of that void once. And it had *answered*.

Could he reach again?

Would it answer *twice*?

Vanesh raised his hand for the finishing blow. “You fought well, Kael.”

He meant it.

This wasn’t mockery.

This was **respect**.

And that… *enraged* Kael.

**I don’t need your respect. I need more.**

The hunger howled.

The shimmer flared.

Kael rose again—but slower this time.

The blue shimmer around him dimmed, flickering like a dying flame.

His instincts still screamed, but now they weren’t urging him to fight.

They were begging him to **run**.

Vanesh stood tall, brushing dust off his sleeves like a man preparing to step into court—not battle. The light around him shifted, subtle distortions rippling through the air.

And then—

**Snap.**

A wave pulsed from him—silent, yet suffocating. The ground beneath Kael cracked, unable to bear the weight of Vanesh’s presence.

“This has gone on long enough,” Vanesh muttered. “The thrill is gone.”

Kael’s breath caught.

Every fiber of his being screamed in protest. His legs refused to budge. His body was lead. His mind—a blur of static.

But something deeper clicked.

**He couldn’t win this.**

Not now.

Not like this.

Vanesh raised a hand, and the world seemed to *tighten*. Space itself folded unnaturally around his form as dozens—**no, hundreds**—of rupture points shimmered into visibility around Kael.

On the ground.

In the air.

Even **inside his body.**

**“I let you dance. You should’ve bowed out when it was beautiful.”**

Vanesh clenched his fist.

Kael moved.

Not toward Vanesh—but **away**.

With the last of his flickering power, he tore through the air behind him, space warping unnaturally under his feet. It wasn’t teleportation—it was **instinctive spatial navigation**, a rough, untrained burst of something deeper.

But Vanesh was faster.

A shimmer blinked beside Kael—Vanesh reappearing, hand already cocked back.

**BOOM—**

The strike connected. Kael’s side erupted in agony, ribs crunching under the pressure. Blood sprayed from his lips.

But he didn’t stop.

**Couldn’t** stop.

He twisted midair, letting the spatial energy around him pulse again—this time not in control, but out of **pure, burning need**.

**Let me live—**

He crashed through trees. Stone. A wall. His body flung like a cannonball through terrain, bones breaking, skin tearing, but the shimmer still flickered faintly—just enough to blur his figure.

Then—stillness.

No more rupture detonations. No more chasing pressure.

Only wind.

Only pain.

Kael lay in a ravine, vision spinning, blood pooling beneath him.

He had escaped.

But barely.

His left arm hung limp—fractured in multiple places. His side caved inward unnaturally. One eye was swollen shut, and the spatial shimmer had long faded.

But he was alive.

And for now, **that was enough**.

Far in the distance, Vanesh stood on a cliff, arms crossed, gaze scanning the forest with sharp calm.

He didn’t pursue.

He didn’t need to.

“I told you,” he murmured, voice lost to the wind. “The fight ended before it began.”

He turned away.

Kael, barely conscious, clung to life with bloodied fingers and gritted teeth.

**This wasn’t the end.**

It was just the debt he owed for surviving.

--- Chapter 19 – The Road Back 1ce7553b55e780d3a682f04724dc53cb.md ---

# Chapter 19 – The Road Back

Kael stumbled forward, legs dragging like rusted chains. Blood trickled down his temple, painting the dirt below with every unsteady step.

The forest around him blurred—shadows and light merging into a grey wash. He couldn’t tell how far he’d come. Couldn’t tell how long it had been.

Seconds?

Minutes?

Hours?

Time had unraveled into a haze of pain.

"I made it out..."

*"But did I even survive?"*

The fight played on loop in his mind—each strike, each word etched in brutal clarity.

Vanesh’s calm expression. The way he dissected every move. The way he ended it like it was nothing. Like *Kael* was nothing.

“You thought I was matching your moves because I needed to?”

*“No. I was dancing while laying traps.”*

Kael clenched his jaw. Blood mixed with saliva in his mouth. The taste was familiar—bitter and metallic.

"Is this what I am? Still just the punching bag? Still just the stray with nothing to offer but a strong jaw and stubborn legs?"

A sudden crack of a twig beneath his foot startled him—not because of the sound, but because he hadn’t *noticed* it coming. His senses dulled. His body lagging. The flicker of power that had carried him through the battle was already fading.

Even the blue hue was gone now.

His vision swam. Then—

Memories surfaced.

---

*He was ten.*

Lying in the mud behind the orphanage.

Bloodied lip. Torn shirt. That cracked rib that made breathing feel like drowning.

The older boys stood over him, sneering.

*“Still think you're special, pretty boy?”*

He remembered the sting of each blow. Not the physical pain—it faded. But the humiliation?

That stuck like tar.

"Back then, I thought I'd hit rock bottom. I swore I'd never feel like that again. Never."

"Guess I was wrong."

---

Kael swayed, knees buckling. He forced himself upright, leaning against a tree.

Then it hit him.

**The hunger.**

That unbearable, suffocating hunger.

It returned like a curse—twisting his insides, gnawing at his core.

Worse than ever.

"No. Not now. Why now?"

He thought the bark from the Awakening had silenced it.

"So what the hell is this? Why does it feel like it’s not just hunger..."

"...but something else? Something waiting to be fed?"

His stomach ached, not from injury—but from emptiness. His limbs trembled. Cold sweat crawled down his spine.

It wasn’t just pain.

It was **craving**.

Something primal.

Something wrong.

"I don’t know what’s happening to me. I don’t know what I’m becoming."

"But I’m scared."

He moved again.

Didn’t know where he was going.

Didn’t care.

His sense of direction was gone. The forest was one long stretch of shadow and silence.

Only his will moved him now.

One foot.

Then another.

Then another.

"I won’t die here."

*"I can’t die here."*

"Not when I’ve tasted it—just a glimpse of what I could become."

And then—

A shape emerged from the haze.

A wall.

A gate.

Rusty iron bars, bent slightly from years of mischief and weather.

The orphanage.

"Home."

"Or… whatever passes for one."

"I made it."

Kael’s lips twitched into a broken smile.

"Heh. Bet the others would still laugh if they saw me now."

His knees gave way.

The last thing he saw before the world went black was the cracked wooden sign above the gate, swinging gently in the wind.

Then—

**Darkness.**

Meanwhile………

The clearing was silent now.

Only the wind moved, stirring dust and broken leaves where once fists had flown and blood had spilled.

Vanesh stood at the center, breathing slow and steady. His uniform, once pristine, was torn in places. The side of his ribs ached—a deep, pulsing throb beneath the skin. He rolled his shoulder with a wince.

“Damn…” he muttered, glancing at the crimson smear on his palm after brushing his side.

He hadn't expected *that*.

“He actually tagged me.”

He exhaled slowly, eyes narrowing as he stared in the direction Kael had escaped.

The fight replayed in his mind, each movement analyzed with the cold precision of a killer. Kael’s rhythm, his desperate instincts, the sheer physicality—nothing surprising for someone rough around the edges with a natural brawler’s talent.

But that final exchange...

That **shift**.

The *blue hue* that wrapped around Kael like a living aura.

The *piercing blow* that slipped through his guard and cracked his ribs—Vanesh *felt* that.

“What the hell was that?”

“It wasn’t some brute-force fluke. It cut through my defense like it bent space itself.”

“I’ve mimicked hundreds of fighters… Seen every elemental burst, every flashy noble gimmick… But that?”

“That was different.”

Unfamiliar.

Uncomfortably so.

He lifted his shirt slightly and hissed. Bruising. Deep, already blooming across his torso like blooming ink.

“Not bad, kid. You earned that one.”

His eyes flicked to the side.

Lying against a nearby tree, limp and unconscious, was Ravon—his so-called “employer.”

Vanesh sighed. “Right. You.”

The guy had been out cold since the middle of the fight. Caught a stray hit when Kael broke through a tree. Pathetic, really.

With a grunt, Vanesh slung Ravon over his shoulder like a sack of laundry. The noble’s limp hand dragged along the ground as Vanesh walked.

---

By the time he reached the gates of Dainvaar—a noble manor turned academy dormitory—he was already irritated.

The guards stiffened as he approached, eyes widening as they recognized him and the man on his shoulder.

“You—he—what happened?!”

Vanesh dropped Ravon unceremoniously at their feet.

“He tripped,” Vanesh said dryly. “On a fist.”

One of the guards stammered, “T-This was supposed to be a small lesson! He said the target was some orphan brat—”

“He was wrong,” Vanesh cut in, gaze sharp. “Don’t send me into fights based on *noble gossip.*”

The guards looked at each other nervously.

Vanesh cracked his neck, then looked past them at the glowing windows of the academy. “You nobles think you have everything figured out. But that kid…”

He shook his head.

“That wasn’t someone you ‘teach a lesson.’ That was someone who *survived* a lesson meant to kill him.”

He turned to leave, then paused.

“Next time you send someone to deal with Kael… make sure it’s not someone you *like.*”

With that, Vanesh walked away—his shadow vanishing into the night.

# Chapter 2( The Boy Who Didn't Belong)

The sun peeked through the old, cracked windows of the orphanage, casting golden streaks across the worn-out wooden floors. Among the many children who scurried about, one stood apart—not by choice, but by nature.

### 

Kael was unlike any other child in the orphanage. He had sharp, well-defined features that seemed almost sculpted, his deep, piercing eyes holding a strange allure that made it difficult to look away. His skin was smooth but unnaturally flawless, as if untouched by the dirt and grime that clung to other children. His jet-black hair shimmered subtly under the light, carrying faint hints of dark blue in certain angles, giving it an almost ethereal quality.

But what stood out most was the strange, almost hypnotic aura around him—an inexplicable charm that made him the center of attention, whether he wanted it or not.

### 

Kael had spent his entire life within the confines of the orphanage. The place was a large, run-down estate, once belonging to an old noble house that had long since crumbled into irrelevance. Now, it housed children with nowhere else to go. Meals were simple, space was cramped, and survival meant knowing how to fend for yourself.

Despite the hardships, Kael never truly suffered in the way others did. While most children grew weak from hunger and sickness, Kael remained unnaturally robust. While fights often broke out over stolen food or personal grudges, Kael rarely found himself on the losing end of any conflict. He was strong—far stronger than any child his age had any right to be.

But strength only brought trouble.

### 

There was something... off about Kael. It wasn’t just his striking looks or his unnatural resilience—it was his **hunger**.

Kael ate more than anyone else in the orphanage. A single meal that satisfied another child barely took the edge off his hunger. Bread, fruits, meat—nothing was ever enough. The caretakers often scolded him, warning that food was scarce and needed to be shared. But no matter how much he consumed, the gnawing void in his stomach remained.

One evening, as Kael went for a third serving of stew, the orphanage caretaker, an older woman with sharp eyes and a no-nonsense attitude, blocked his way.

“Kael,” she sighed, rubbing her temples. “This is the third time today. We barely have enough for everyone.”

“I’m still hungry,” Kael said simply. His tone wasn’t desperate, nor was it apologetic. It was a fact, as if he were stating that the sky was blue or that water was wet.

The caretaker narrowed her eyes while muttering “You eat more than anyone here. And yet, you’re never full. What are you, a bottomless pit?”

Kael didn’t respond. He couldn’t. He didn’t understand it himself.

The caretaker shook her head and handed him a half-filled bowl. “This is the last one, you hear me? If I catch you sneaking into the storeroom again, you’ll be scrubbing the floors for a week.”

Kael took the bowl and walked away, ignoring the curious glances from the other children. He never stole food, never begged for extra. But the hunger never left him. It was as if his body demanded something more—something the orphanage couldn’t provide.

### 

Kael’s presence created two kinds of reactions—**admiration** and **hatred**.

Many of the younger children were drawn to him, fascinated by his confidence and natural charm. They watched in awe as he fought off older bullies with ease, his movements almost instinctual, as if he had been fighting his whole life. Some looked up to him as an older brother, seeking his protection in the harsh orphanage life.

But not everyone admired him.

The older boys, the ones who had ruled the orphanage with intimidation and brute strength, saw him as a threat. His looks, his strength, his effortless way of attracting attention—it all fed into their resentment. Attempts to bully him ended in failure, further deepening their hatred.

And so, Kael lived in a strange paradox—**admired by some, hated by many, and truly close to none.**

### 

---

One day, as Kael returned to his sleeping quarters, he found three older boys waiting for him. The ringleader, a broad-shouldered boy named Varrin, stood with his arms crossed, smirking.

“You think you’re better than us, don’t you?” Varrin sneered.

Kael stopped a few feet away, his expression unreadable. “No.”

“Liar,” Varrin spat. “You act like you don’t care, but you walk around like you own this place. Like you’re special.”

Kael said nothing. He had learned long ago that words rarely solved anything. He just thought ”this again?”

Varrin’s smirk widened. “Let’s see if you’re as tough as you look.”

Without warning, he lunged.

Most fights in the orphanage were messy—wild punches, desperate kicks, grappling until someone gave up. But Kael’s body moved differently. His instincts flared, warning him of the incoming attack before it even landed. He sidestepped at the last moment, Varrin’s punch whiffing past his cheek.

Kael’s knee shot up, slamming into Varrin’s stomach. The older boy staggered back, coughing violently. But before Kael could finish the fight, the other two boys jumped in.

A fist aimed for his ribs—he twisted his body, letting it graze past him. Another punch came for his head—he ducked, feeling the air shift above him. But then, a third strike, a wild swing from the side, slammed into his shoulder.

The impact sent a dull throb through his body. Kael exhaled sharply, rolling his shoulder back into place.

 “**Pointless. It’d be fine by tomorrow.”**

Then he moved.

Faster than the boys could track, he weaved between their attacks, his body flowing like water. A sharp elbow to the gut sent one boy gasping to the ground. A swift kick took out the legs of the other. In the span of a few breaths, it was over.

Around them, a small crowd of younger children had gathered. Some whispered excitedly, eyes wide with admiration. Others just stared, unsure whether to be impressed or afraid. It was always like this.

Varrin and his friends lay groaning on the floor, while Kael stood over them, untouched—except for the faint ache in his shoulder, which he had already stopped paying attention to.

Varrin glared up at him, panting. “You… freak…do you not feel pain?”

Kael stared down at him, his expression blank. Then, without a word, he turned and walked away.

He didn’t enjoy fighting. But he wouldn’t lose, either.

In the orphanage, strength meant survival.

And Kael had no intention of being weak.

# Chapter 20 - Whispers in the Dark

Darkness.

It stretched infinitely, neither cold nor warm, just *empty*. Kael floated in it—not sleeping, not dreaming. Simply *drifting*.

Then came the **whispers**.

“You could end this weakness.”

*“All it takes is one choice.”*

*“Why suffer when you were born to rule?”*

The void around him twisted. Darkness pulsed, thickened, and then **bled** into something else—crimson skies, a ground of cracked bone and ash. The air was heavy with the scent of iron. Shadows slithered beneath the surface like snakes under water.

Kael stood there, barefoot, surrounded by ruin.

Then came *him*.

A twisted reflection stepped out from the dark—a version of Kael, but taller, eyes burning with gold fire, grin sharp and predatory.

He spoke with Kael’s voice—but laced with venom, arrogance, **hunger**.

“Look at you,” he sneered. “Bleeding. Crawling. Begging for scraps.”

“You were born of power. And all you’ve done is hide.”

Kael tried to speak, but the air was thick—each breath burned like acid.

Around him, illusions flickered.

Nobles laughing.

Ravon spitting blood.

Children mocking his hunger.

And then—

**The throne.**

Built from shattered bones, twisted steel, and scorched banners.

At its base, the *real Kael* stood.

The version on the throne lounged lazily, one hand resting on a sword forged of shadows.

“They feared us.”

*“And you’ve been trying to be one of them?”*

*“Pathetic.”*

Kael’s feet moved on their own. Closer to the throne. Closer to him. To *it*.

The whispers rose again—now a chorus.

“Feed.”

*“Burn.”*

*“Kill.”*

Kael’s hunger surged.

He doubled over. His insides felt like they were collapsing into a black hole. Every cell screamed in craving. For food. For flesh. For *power*.

Then—

**Blue light.**

It crackled through the dreamscape like lightning.

The throne shattered.

The twisted Kael roared, **lunging forward**—

But the world caved in.

The whispers fell silent.

---

Kael gasped awake.

Back in the real world, his body trembled in soaked sheets. His breath ragged, his eyes unfocused.

Standing beside him was **the elder**.

Expression blank. Wrinkled hands still holding a sliver of the **Awakening Bark**, now dull and spent.

He placed it down, turned, and walked away.

No words.

No explanations.

No comfort.

Just quiet footsteps fading down the hall.

Kael stared at the ceiling, the dream still coiled in his bones like smoke after fire.

The hunger had retreated. Caged. For now.

But he remembered its voice.

Its eyes.

Its grin.

And the throne.

"That thing... was me?"

The thought hit like a hammer. Cold. Heavy.

"Or... could be me."

His mind replayed the dream, frame by frame. The confidence, the rage, the raw **dominance** of that version. The way the world bent around him. The way everything *feared* him.

And for a second—

A single, terrifying second—

Kael understood it.

He understood the power. The **appeal** of it.

"So this is what they mean when they say power corrupts."

He closed his eyes, exhaling slow.

"Was that who I really am?"

*"Or who I’ll become if I give in?"*

*"Or was it something trying to break me—to replace me?"*

His fists curled under the sheets.

"It felt good."

*"To not be weak."*

*"To not care."*

"But it wasn’t me."

*"It couldn’t have been."*

He wanted strength—but not at the cost of himself.

"I don’t want to be a monster with a crown."

His breath caught.

The throne still lingered in his mind—beckoning, pulsing with promise.

And with it, a question that he couldn’t shake:

"If the world keeps trying to break me..."

*"How long before I sit on that throne willingly?"*

Kael turned his head to the side, eyes narrowing.

No answers came.

Just the quiet hum of the night.

But in that silence, he made a vow:

"If I ever get that strong..."

*"I’ll still be me."*

"Even if it kills me to hold on."

---

Days passed.

The orphanage was silent. Most didn’t know Kael had returned. Those who did said nothing.

The elder tended to Kael’s wounds—dressing them, changing linens, ensuring he could breathe and walk. Nothing more.

Kael appreciated it, in his own quiet way.

But outside those wooden walls, **chaos bloomed**.

---

The **Academy** buzzed with whispers.

The incident spread faster than fire on dry grass.

“Someone destroyed Ravon.”

*“No way that’s true. Dainvaar nobles don’t lose fights.”*

*“I heard the orphan cheated—used a forbidden power.”*

*“There’s no way he did that without help. Must’ve had a relic.”*

*“He’s dangerous. He should be locked up.”*

No one knew **who** Kael fought.

Vanesh's identity remained buried.

And that terrified them more than the result.

Because **someone** had torn through Dainvaar.

And no one could explain how.

Behind closed doors, the Dainvaar elders lobbied for punishment.

Some demanded Kael’s expulsion.

Others pushed for a full investigation.

But nothing happened. Not yet.

And that silence?

It was louder than any accusation.

---

Kael sat up for the first time in days.

He was still sore. Still weak. But his mind was sharper.

Clearer.

The dream hadn’t faded. Not entirely. The throne. The whispers. The *other him*—they lingered in his thoughts.

“That wasn’t just a nightmare.”

*“That thing… is inside me.”*

He clenched his fists.

“I can’t let it out.”

He stood, legs trembling but steady.

Walked to the basin, stared at his reflection.

Bruised.

Bloodied.

But alive.

“I’m not like them. I never was.”

*“But that doesn’t make me a monster.”*

*“Not unless I let it.”*

He took a slow breath.

The hunger was gone.

But the fire?

Still there.

A quiet, growing flame behind his eyes.

“They want to bury me in rumors? Let them.”

*“They want to test me again? Let them.”*

*“But next time—”*

*“I won't be the one crawling back.”*

Kael turned away from the mirror.

And for the first time since the fight—

**He smiled.**

Not in triumph.

Not in pride.

But in defiance.

# Chapter 21 - The Weight of Whispers

---

Kael's muscles ached with every move. A week had passed, but the fight hadn’t left him. Dull pain and sharp jolts still ran through him, reminders of how close he’d come to dying. The bruises, dark and fading, stretched across his torso like a map of everything that had gone wrong. The cuts had closed, but the skin felt tight, raw underneath. Pain clung to him now—not as an enemy, but as something familiar. Proof he was still here.

He stood shirtless in the orphanage courtyard. The morning air hit him hard, cold against the heat still trapped in his wounds. He didn’t shy away from it. This was a test, one only he could give himself.

One step forward. Pivot. Elbow strike. Drop. Twist. Rise.

Every motion was careful, as if his body and will were still figuring out how to work together. It wasn’t clean yet. There were stumbles, small delays. But he was adjusting. Faster than he expected.

Something’s different, he thought, picking up on a shift he couldn’t name. A tension under his skin, like something watching, waiting. His instincts felt sharper now. He noticed things—balance, breath, tiny breaks in his stance. Even the way the wind moved through the trees felt clearer, like the world was speaking in a language he could finally hear.

He shut his eyes and took a deep breath. Cool air filled his lungs and chased off what was left of last night’s dream.

The hunger was gone.

But not erased.

It was still there, tucked away inside him. Waiting. He could feel it just out of reach, like something crouched behind his ribs. It’s still here, he thought, a chill running through him. He didn’t need to look in a mirror to know he’d changed. Something in his eyes had. Something behind them.

The Academy gates stood in the distance. Old stone. Older rules. A future already waiting to judge him. He stepped forward, leaving behind the orphanage and the quiet he’d built there.

The change hit him as soon as he crossed through. It was in the air. Like walking into a room right after an argument. Voices dropped. Conversations died halfway through. Eyes followed him—some looked away fast, pretending they hadn’t seen. Others didn’t even try to hide it. There was curiosity. Unease. And something like fear.

Whispers floated through the crowd.

“There he is.”

“That’s him.”

“The one who… you know.”

Kael kept walking. No reaction. No shift in pace. He wasn’t angry. He didn’t feel much at all. Just aware. Everything was different now.

Not the world.

Him.

He wasn’t just Kael, the orphan. He was Kael, the one who came back changed.

He didn’t have to go looking for anyone. They found him first.

“Kael!”

A voice rang out—too loud, too sure. Aeron Vayrath. Tall. Lean. Always in motion. Wrapped in way too many clothes for spring, like he expected a snowstorm. He ran over, boots thudding on stone, and clamped a hand on Kael’s shoulder.

“You look like crap. Good to see nothing’s changed.” The grin was wide, but there was something honest in the way his eyes looked him over.

Kael blinked. Almost smiled. “Thanks for the warm welcome, Aeron.”

Kaelan Vaelstrom followed behind, slower, quieter. Where Aeron was a fire, Kaelan was smoke. He moved with purpose, his long coat trailing behind, hand resting on a sword he wasn’t supposed to have. No one was going to tell him that, though.

“You’re walking,” Kaelan said, voice low. “Better than the last update I got.”

Aeron waved him off. “That update said he exploded. Or maybe imploded. Either way, it was dramatic. Classic Kael.”

Kael let out a slow breath. “I’m alright, guys.”

Kaelan tilted his head, studying him. “Are you truly?” He looked like he could see past skin and bone.

Kael paused. The memories pressed in, heavy. He wanted to talk. He really did. But the words wouldn’t come. How could he explain what it had felt like? The thing inside him that still lingered?

He gave the only truth he could. “I’m still standing.”

Aeron slapped him on the back, rough but real. “Well then, O Mighty Survivor of Mystery Assassins and Noble Rage Babies, let’s go get food. I’ve been living off bread and boiled roots. If I see another turnip, I swear I’ll stab something. Probably myself.”

Kael gave a small smile. It was real. Their rhythm, the way they spoke to each other—it helped. It made the world feel less sharp. “Lead the way.”

The dining hall was quieter than usual. Not silent. Just... strained. Every sound seemed smaller. People looked. Eyes tracked him. Not rude, not hostile. Just... watching.

He picked up on the shifts. More guards. Teachers he didn’t recognize, keeping their hands close to their weapons. Even the headmaster’s assistant, usually calm and unreadable, looked at him once—then quickly looked away. Her hands trembled a little as she held her scroll.

They’re watching me, he thought, a tightness curling in his gut. Not accusing. Just cautious. Like he was a bomb they didn’t know how to defuse.

They don’t know what I am. And that scared them more than anything else.

After a mostly silent meal, Kael stepped outside, looking for air and space. He sat under an old tree in the courtyard. Aeron and Kaelan took spots nearby, already knee-deep in one of their endless debates.

Probably arguing over sword forms again. Or if sword forms counted as poetry. They tended to blur those lines.

Kael let the sound of their voices wash over him. It helped. The noise grounded him. Reminded him where he was.

But it didn’t last.

Someone approached. Heavy steps. A shadow stretched across the ground. Professor Halric. One of the academy’s battle instructors. Old-school. Stern. Didn’t trust anything he couldn’t explain.

He stopped in front of Kael, arms crossed. “Walk with me.”

It wasn’t a question.

Kael stood. No rush. No pushback. He just followed.

They moved along the academy paths. Students were scattered through training fields and meditation circles. No one said anything. But something hung in the air.

Halric finally spoke, voice rough like worn stone.

“You were nearly killed.”

A flat statement. No emotion. But Kael caught something in the silence between the words. Respect. Or maybe worry.

He didn’t answer.

“You survived something no common student would have.” Still watching him.

Kael’s jaw tensed. Common student. Like he didn’t belong here.

Halric stopped walking. Faced him. Eyes sharp.

“Some say you cheated. Others think someone helped you. Some…” His voice dropped. Low. Dark. “…think you’re not what you say you are.”

Kael met his gaze. Hard. “I didn’t cheat.”

Halric didn’t flinch. “You didn’t answer the second part.”

Kael said nothing. The words were too big. Too heavy. What am I? He looked at his hands like they belonged to someone else.

Halric sighed. “Control yourself, Kael. Eyes are on you now. And not all of them are kind.” There was something quieter in his tone now. A warning. “The nobles… they’ve got plans of their own.”

Then he walked off. No farewell. Just gone.

Kael stood still, alone in the quiet of the garden. Leaves rustled overhead. Petals drifted down and scattered around his feet.

He didn’t move. Couldn’t. Halric’s words pressed down on him. The whispers. The fear. The weight of not knowing who—or what—he really was.

Then his hand curled into a fist. Tight. His jaw clenched.

Let them watch. Let them guess. Let them be afraid.

He wasn’t going to hide anymore.

When the truth came out—

They’d understand.

# Chapter 22: The Demonstration

After 10 months…

"Time didn't just pass; it changed Kael. It was a constant cycle of training, a brutal routine of sweat and strain. Whispers about him filled the academy, rumors spreading everywhere, but Kael refused to give in. He pushed his body past its limits. Every muscle ached, every fiber burned, but it drove him. The nights became his time to focus, the training grounds his place of dedication, where he pushed through pain to become stronger.

The faint blue glow under his skin suddenly exploded with bright energy. It pulsed and vibrated like a storm contained within him, with raw power crackling off it. His awareness of space wasn't just better; it was like a sixth sense, almost like he could see the future and react. He moved with a strange grace, so smoothly it was almost like he wasn't there, a speed that no one should have. He didn't just react; he knew what was coming. He didn't just fight; he was in control of what would happen.

He didn't just get better after the battle with Vanesh—he broke through what he thought he could do. He was reborn from that near-death experience, made stronger by his inner conflict, and what came out of it was something… impossible to ignore. He was like a force of nature barely kept in a human body.

Now—Under the hot midday sun, the training field became a stage for a display of raw power. You could feel the energy in the air, a mix of the excitement of youth and the tension before a big fight.

"Take this!" Aeron yelled, his voice loud enough to break glass. He threw a flurry of punches, each one obvious and telegraphed, ~~a mess of arms and wild intent~~. He was all show and no substance, with exaggerated movements meant to scare, not hurt.

"You fight like a wild pig," Kaelan said, his voice mocking. He easily avoided Aeron's clumsy attacks, his long dark coat flowing around him. He moved smoothly and efficiently, showing how much power he had under control. With a casual flick of his wrist and a perfectly timed palm strike, he sent Aeron flying through the air like a ragdoll.

Aeron crashed into the dusty ground, making a small crater and sending dust everywhere. He jumped back up with a dramatic groan, grinning like a maniac, and attacked again with endless energy. Their fight was a chaotic dance, a mix of over-the-top moves and playful insults, a familiar routine of aggression and friendship.

Nearby, students sparred ~~without much enthusiasm~~, their attention completely taken by what was happening in the center of the field. All eyes were on the main event, the center of raw power: Kael vs. Instructor Halric.

This was supposed to be a "demonstration." A polite exchange of moves. No flashy powers, no using elements, just pure, honed skill. A display of discipline and focus.

But Halric wasn't an idiot. He could feel the change in Kael. The air around him seemed to vibrate with a restrained, almost threatening energy. Kael wasn't just stronger; he gave off a dangerous, untamed power that made Halric's hair stand on end.

Halric attacked first, using a textbook strike. It was a powerful, precise punch, the result of years of training. A punch that could break bones. But Kael wasn't there. He moved with an almost unreal speed, a blur that was hard to see, avoiding Halric's attack as if it was in slow motion. It was like he knew what Halric was going to do before he even did it.

Their fists collided with a shockwave of force, an impact that shook the entire training field. Dust and wind exploded outwards. It wasn't just a clash of flesh and bone; it was a meeting of wills, a contest of raw power.

Halric stumbled back, his eyes wide with shock and disbelief. He hadn't just felt the physical power of the blow; he'd felt the intent behind it, the barely controlled energy that threatened to overwhelm him.

"What… what is this?" he muttered, a hint of fear in his voice. He felt like he was facing something more than a student.

Kael's lips curled into a slight, knowing smile. It wasn't arrogant, but it had a chilling certainty to it.

To anyone watching who didn't know better, it looked like a close match. A clash of titans, a contest of skill and power.

But Halric felt the truth deep down. Kael wasn't just reading his moves; he was seeing what was going to happen. Every tiny muscle twitch, every slight shift in weight, every micro-expression, every flicker of intent—Kael's enhanced awareness processed it all instantly. It was like fighting a ghost, someone who knew your every move before you made it.

He wasn't fighting Halric; he was fighting every possible outcome at once, a terrifying dance with fate itself.

Halric attacked again, a wild flurry of strikes. Faster, more aggressive, driven by growing panic. But Kael flowed through them, a whirlwind of blue energy and impossible speed. He countered with lightning-fast precision, each strike aimed perfectly, designed to exploit the smallest weakness.

Then—Kael moved.

It wasn't a punch; it was an explosion of force, a calculated strike that sent a shockwave of power through Halric's body. It was as if Kael had channeled pure kinetic energy into a single, devastating blow.

Halric was launched through the air, his body slamming into the ground with enough force to create a small crater. The ground cracked beneath him.

The training ground became completely silent. Even Aeron and Kaelan, in the middle of their fight, froze, their jaws dropping in disbelief. The sheer power and speed of Kael's attack had left them speechless.

Kael stood, calm and collected, as if he had just been warming up. He showed no arrogance or sign of effort. Just a quiet, unnerving stillness that spoke volumes about his newfound control.

Halric struggled to his feet, his body shaking uncontrollably. He was defeated, his pride crushed, his authority challenged in front of everyone.

Instructor Raelis, watching from the sidelines with a sharp, analytical gaze, whispered to a colleague, her voice low and thoughtful. "That's not just skill. It's… something else. He moves with an unnatural grace, like he's already fought this battle a thousand times in his head."

Her colleague's voice was hushed, filled with a growing unease. "He's too perfect. Too strong. Too… refined. It's almost like he's not bound by the same rules as the rest of us. It's… unnatural."

Raelis's eyes narrowed, her gaze fixed on Kael with a mix of fascination and apprehension. "He's not like the others. There's a darkness inside him, a power he's barely holding back. A power that could destroy him… or us."

"No," the other instructor breathed, his voice barely audible. "He's not."

On the field, Halric, driven by a desperate mix of pride and defiance, charged again. But it was pointless, a final attempt to salvage his dignity. Kael stepped forward, an aura of blue energy flaring around him like a protective shield. And Halric froze."

# Chapter 23 - Unfinished Business

Halric froze—not because he chose to, but because something primal screamed at him not to move.

His instincts, honed over decades of combat, rebelled. Every nerve in his body fired alarms. The energy around Kael was suffocating, *unbound*, like standing at the cliff's edge with a storm rising behind you, the ground crumbling beneath your feet.

But Halric was no rookie. He’d felt fear before. He’d fought monsters, calamities, men who had bathed in blood. He gritted his teeth, ignoring the weight pressing down on him, and surged with his own power.

Golden energy burst from his body, clashing violently against the swirling blue aura around Kael. For a heartbeat, the world became still—two forces meeting in the open, locked in silent tension.

“*Enough!*” Halric’s voice cracked like a whip, layered with energy. A command, not a request.

The shockwave that followed wasn’t from fists—it was from will. Dust exploded from the ground. Students nearby staggered back, some falling over. The oppressive pressure lifted instantly, the training field returning to silence.

Kael blinked, not in confusion, but control—reining it in just in time, the blue aura crackled once, then folded in on itself like a vanishing tide. The silence that followed was absolute.. The hunger in his expression faded, replaced by cold clarity. He took a slow breath and lowered his stance, nodding once—not in submission, but in acknowledgement.

Halric finally dismissed the class, the tension slowly beginning to dissipate as the students broke formation. But Kael didn't move. Neither did Varien. They remained locked in their silent confrontation, two figures standing on opposite sides of a battlefield, the coming storm reflected in their eyes.

A promise carved into flesh and sealed in blood. A reckoning that was coming, inevitable as the rising sun.

There was no anger, no hatred, not anymore. Those emotions had been replaced by something colder, something more focused.

Only unfinished business. 

Their eyes locked, the distance between them seeming to vanish. The world around them faded away, the noise of the academy receding into a muted hum. In that shared gaze, no words were necessary. The air between them thrummed with unspoken intent, a silent conversation conducted in the language of rivalry and anticipation.

**“Gather up.”**

Groans. Shuffling feet. The students fell into formation, some casting wary glances at Kael.

Even Aeron and Kaelan were silent. No jokes. No jabs. Just the heavy understanding that something had shifted.

Halric stood tall before them, his tone returning to command.

The class shifted, weight passing from foot to foot, unspoken questions clawing at the back of every mind

“Your End-of-Year Exams are approaching.”

Aeron and Kaelan exchanged a long look, all traces of their usual banter gone. The playful aggression was replaced by a shared understanding of the gravity of the situation. There was no room for bravado now—only preparation.

Murmurs rippled, but no one dared speak.

**“There are two components,”** Halric continued. “First, a written test—history, theory, discipline. Fail it, and you don’t fight.”

“Second…” he paused, letting the tension build.

“A ranked, elimination-based tournament.”

The weight of that statement hung heavy in the air, the implications clear and undeniable. This wasn't just an exam; it was a judgment. A weeding out of the weak, a confirmation of the strong. Their futures rested on this.

"And only those who prove they're truly ready shall advance to the next year."

His gaze intensified, focusing on each student in turn.

"You will be seen. Evaluated. Compared."

He paused again, letting his words resonate.

He folded his arms across his broad chest, his stance firm and unyielding.

His gaze swept across the group, lingering on certain individuals, a silent challenge in his eyes. "And yes," he added, a hint of grim amusement in his voice, "some of you will lose. Spectacularly."

"This is no simple sparring match," Halric emphasized, his voice sharp and commanding. "It's a ranked, elimination-based format. You'll be assessed not just on brute strength—but on strategy, adaptability, awareness, and control. It's not about how flashy you can be, it's about surviving and dominating under pressure."

A wave of emotion surged through the crowd, a visible ripple of excitement and dread that washed over them. This was what they had been working towards, the ultimate test of their combat prowess. But it was also a terrifying prospect, a reminder of the potential for failure and the harsh consequences that awaited those who fell short.

“Watch out, you might fail” Kaelan said, nudging Aeron with a smirk.

Aeron's head whipped around, his eyes narrowing. "Shut it, Kaelan."

Halric began to pace slowly before the group, his gaze sweeping across their faces. His tone shifted, the sternness softening into something more instructive, though the underlying edge of warning remained. "All of you have made progress. Some more than others," he added, his eyes flicking almost imperceptibly toward Kael. "You've transitioned from flailing wildly to displaying something resembling actual technique."

The students, with varying degrees of reluctance, shuffled into formation. Some couldn't resist one last glance toward Kael, their expressions a complex blend of awe, fear, and morbid curiosity. Even Aeron and Kaelan, usually a constant source of noise and playful insults, had fallen uncharacteristically silent, the gravity of what they'd just witnessed weighing heavily on them. For a few precious seconds.

“Just imagine the look on old Theron’s face when I win this whole thing,” Aeron muttered under his breath, a spark of his usual bravado returning.

Kaelan snorted softly. “The only spectacular thing will be your inevitable defeat, you overgrown ferret.”

Aeron’s retort was cut short by Halric’s next words, his voice brooking no further distractions.

Halric's gaze swept over them one last time, a silent assessment of their readiness. "You have one week," he announced, his voice firm and unwavering. "One week to prepare. To rest. To hone yourselves into the weapons you are meant to be." He paused, letting the weight of his words sink in. "Do not underestimate this exam. It will test you in ways you cannot yet imagine." With a final, curt nod, he dismissed them. The breath they’d all been holding finally released—as if the storm had passed, but not yet ended.

# Chapter 3 – The Path to Awakening

The classroom was vast, a grand hall carved from dark stone, its high ceilings adorned with intricate carvings of calamities past. Large, arched windows allowed golden rays of light to spill in, casting long shadows that danced across the polished obsidian floors. The scent of aged parchment, burning incense, and faint traces of ozone from magic hung in the air. Rows of desks, each carved from a different type of enchanted wood, were arranged in a semi-circle around a central lectern, designed to place emphasis on the instructor while still allowing the students to observe one another.

The nobles occupied the front rows, their pristine uniforms decorated with the insignias of their respective houses. Each noble house had a distinct physicality that set them apart. The Veyrath students had sharp, angular features and wild, unkempt hair that crackled with static, as if their very bodies conducted electricity. The Zaryth heirs had sun-kissed skin and eyes that shimmered like molten gold, their presence carrying an innate warmth. The Solmara nobles bore regal, statuesque physiques, their movements precise and deliberate, their golden-eyed gazes unyielding. The Nyxir students had gaunt, almost ethereal faces, their dark attire blending unnaturally with the shadows around them, their very breath seeming to dim the light nearby. The Vaelstrom scions had an uncanny grace, their flowing hair and fluid movements resembling the rolling tides of the sea. And the Dainvaar heirs were built like stone, their robust bodies resembling immovable mountains, every motion carrying the weight of the earth itself.

Beyond them sat the commoners, their expressions varying from curiosity to quiet determination. Their uniforms, though identical in design, lacked the embellishments that marked nobility. While some noble students sneered at their presence, others ignored them altogether, viewing them as insignificant.

Among the nobles, one stood out—not for his strength, but for his growing resentment toward Kael.

Rhovan Dainvaar, a member of the Dainvaar Clan, had always been a staunch believer in the hierarchy of power. To him, Kael was an anomaly, a commoner who did not know his place. Rhovan had witnessed Kael’s strength firsthand, seen how he refused to back down even in the face of noble opposition. And that infuriated him.

Rhovan’s fingers drummed against his desk, his jaw clenched as he leaned toward another noble beside him. "Look at him. Acting like he belongs here," he muttered, his deep voice barely above a growl.

"He doesn’t even flinch anymore," the other noble murmured back, stealing a glance at Kael. "It’s like he’s mocking us."

Rhovan scoffed, crossing his arms. "Let’s see how long that arrogance lasts."

Another noble, a Veyrath student with sparks crackling faintly in his hair, sneered. "Do you remember the old days? When he was just some weak commoner, all bruised up after every lesson?"

A smirk tugged at Rhovan’s lips. "I remember. He used to avoid looking at us, always keeping his head down. He was nothing more than a punching bag."

The noble beside him chuckled. "I swear, I thought he would break after that time in the courtyard. We left him barely able to stand."

Rhovan’s smirk faded as his gaze returned to Kael. "And yet, he didn’t. He just kept getting up. Every time. No matter how much we beat him down."

The nobles fell silent for a moment, watching Kael, who sat with an unwavering posture, completely ignoring their conversation. The defiance in his presence, the quiet strength he carried—it was almost unnatural.

"That’s what pisses me off the most," Rhovan muttered, his fingers curling into a fist. "He doesn’t flinch anymore."

Kael, as usual, was indifferent to the hostility directed at him. He sat near the middle, back straight, his gaze unwavering. The murmurs and whispers around him barely registered. He had long since learned to ignore them.

Just as the tension in the room reached its peak, the heavy wooden doors swung open.

The instructor stepped in, his presence immediately silencing the room. He was not a noble, nor did he belong to any of the great houses, yet his very being commanded respect.

Master Orlin.

A former commoner who had risen through sheer will and talent, Orlin had transcended, an achievement so rare that even the noble houses acknowledged his status as an equal. Clad in a simple yet elegant dark robe, his silvered hair was tied back, revealing a face that bore the wisdom of centuries. His eyes, sharp and piercing, held the weight of countless battles fought and won.

As he entered, the very air in the room seemed to shift. The murmurs ceased, the nobles straightened in their seats, and even Rhovan fell silent, his earlier irritation momentarily forgotten.

He strode to the lectern and cast his gaze over the assembled students. "Power is not a privilege," he said, his voice calm yet commanding. "It is a burden. And those who wield it without understanding will be the first to fall."

Kael felt something stir within him as the lesson began. This would be no ordinary class.

As the lecture concluded, the tension in the room gradually gave way to a different kind of energy—excitement.

Today is the Awakening Ceremony.

Whispers filled the hall as students began discussing their expectations.

"I heard that the firstborn of House Solmara awakened a legendary fire affinity last century," a Zaryth noble mused.

A Nyxir student smirked. "Fire is overrated. True power lies in the shadows. Mark my words, I will awaken something far greater than a mere elemental affinity."

Further down the row, a Vaelstrom noble leaned back in his chair, grinning. "You’re all thinking too small. My family’s bloodline is known for producing prodigies. I wouldn’t be surprised if I awaken something… unprecedented."

The discussion quickly became a contest of arrogance, each noble trying to one-up the other with predictions of their own greatness.

Rhovan cracked his knuckles, his confidence unshaken. "My clan is descended from the earth itself. Every Dainvaar heir has awakened an affinity for earth. I will be no different." He glanced toward Kael with a sneer. "But some people here? I doubt they’ll awaken anything at all."

Several nobles chuckled, their gazes flickering toward Kael, expecting a reaction.

Kael remained silent.

He wasn’t interested in their boasting.

He had no illusions about his own awakening. He knew that the ceremony would change everything—but whether it would be in his favor or not…

That was another matter entirely.

As the nobles continued their chatter, Master Orlin’s voice cut through the noise once more.

"Dismissed."

The students rose from their seats, still engaged in heated discussions about the upcoming ceremony.

Kael stood up as well, his expression unreadable.

Tomorrow, the truth would be revealed.

# Chapter 4(The Echo of Fallen Titans)

The classroom settled into a hush as Master Orlin stood before them, his presence alone enough to command their full attention. The flickering torches on the walls cast long shadows, and the air was thick with the scent of burning incense and aged parchment. With deliberate patience, he surveyed the students, his piercing gaze resting on each one for a brief moment before he began.

"Before you awaken, before you come into your strength, you must understand what it is you seek to wield. Power is not a gift; it is a burden. And those who do not understand it are destined to be consumed by it."

A murmur ran through the room, but no one dared to interrupt. Even the most arrogant nobles listened, for they knew that Orlin was not a man to be ignored.

"Your awakening will reveal your talents—an affinity, an element, a path that will define your growth. Some of you will wield fire, others the earth itself. Some may find their talents lie in speed, in endurance, in intellect. But remember this—no talent is weak; only the wielder determines its worth."

He let the words settle, watching the flickers of pride and determination in their expressions.

"Throughout history, talent alone has never decided the outcome of battle. It is will, strategy, and an unbreakable spirit that shape legends. You will learn of past warriors—of calamities who shaped the very world we live in. But none of it matters if you do not have the strength to stand when the time comes."

Orlin strode to the center of the room, his voice darkening. "And the time will come."

A chill swept through the students.

"The demons do not rest. They do not wait for you to be ready. They have ravaged civilizations, toppled dynasties, and corrupted even the most powerful of us. It is only through unwavering strength that we have endured. It is why we train, why we fight, and why the weak are left behind."

He paused, his gaze settling on the front rows where the nobles sat, then drifting to the commoners. "History has shown us that even among the great houses, even among the strongest bloodlines, none are invincible. Power can be lost. Clans can fall."

A heavy silence fell upon the room.

Orlin stepped forward, his voice quieter but no less intense. "The **Mahakros Clan** once stood among the greatest of noble houses. A family of warriors, unmatched in battle, feared and revered alike. They were the unyielding spear of the calamities, their warriors the first to charge and the last to fall. Their name was synonymous with destruction for any who dared to threaten balance. And yet, they were wiped from history—erased."

Gasps filled the air. The Mahakros name had faded into whispers, a cautionary tale told in hushed voices. No records detailed their fall, only that they had been powerful beyond compare—and that one day, they had ceased to exist.

"But among them, there was one who stood above all others. **Rudrakai Mahakros.** He was not merely a warrior—he was war itself. A tempest given human form, a force that reshaped battlefields in his wake. Alone, he slaughtered the generals of three sins—Sloth, Envy, and Lust. He faced their endless hordes, their nightmarish abominations, and left nothing but ruin in his wake."

The torches flickered as if the very mention of his name disturbed the air.

"In his grasp, he wielded **Trishanva, the Trident of Annihilation**—a weapon said to have been bathed in the blood of fallen calamities and demons alike. With each strike, it shattered the land, split the sky, and reduced the unworthy to dust. No blade could pierce his skin, no spell could bind him, no army could break him. He was a storm clad in flesh, his battle cries shaking the heavens."

A shiver passed through the students. To challenge even one of the seven sins was unthinkable. But to slay three of their generals? The weight of such a feat was beyond comprehension.

"And yet," Orlin continued, his tone solemn, "even he could not escape fate. Even he fell. And the Mahakros name perished with him."

Orlin’s gaze sharpened. "Remember this lesson. Strength is fleeting. Power does not make you untouchable. The moment you grow complacent, you are already dead."

The room was deathly silent.

Kael sat still, his hands clenched into fists beneath the desk. Something about Orlin’s words stirred him, igniting a feeling deep in his bones—an instinct, a calling. The idea of a warrior standing against such impossible odds resonated with him in a way he could not explain.

This was no ordinary lesson.

It was a warning.

And a challenge.

# Chapter 5(Echoes of a Failed Awakening)

The ceremony grounds buzzed with an electric anticipation, the crowd pressing close to witness the grand spectacle. The towering ancestral tree, its bark infused with the essence of the ancient progenitor, stood at the center—a silent judge to those who sought its power.

Master Orlin stood tall, his voice carrying authority as he called the first name. "Aeron Veyrath, step forward."

A tall boy with silver-streaked hair strode to the front, the air around him crackling faintly with static. He took the small shard of bark, pressing it to his lips and chewing slowly. A heartbeat passed before a surge of energy erupted within him. Sparks leaped from his body, his veins glowing with raw power as a gust of wind whipped through the clearing. The crowd gasped in awe.

Orlin raised his hand for silence and announced, "Aeron Veyrath—Lightning and Wind affinity. Talent level: High."

The crowd murmured in approval. "No surprise there," someone whispered. "The Veyrath always command the storms."

Orlin nodded before calling the next name. "Lysara Zaryth."

A girl with fiery red eyes stepped forward. Without hesitation, she swallowed the bark, and flames ignited around her. Fire coiled up her arms like living serpents, their heat distorting the air. She clenched her fists, absorbing the inferno into her skin.

"Lysara Zaryth—Fire affinity. Talent level: High," Orlin declared.

"If she didn’t awaken fire, I would’ve eaten my own boots," someone muttered.

"Rael Solmara."

The golden-haired boy moved with quiet confidence, biting into the bark without hesitation. A radiant glow enveloped him, his silhouette briefly resembling the sun itself.

"Rael Solmara—Light affinity. Talent level: High."

"Expected. But look at that control," a noble murmured. "The Solmara really are something else."

One by one, the noble heirs followed. Shadows curled around Ceylan Nyxir as she dissolved into the darkness itself, her presence flickering between reality and nothingness.

"Ceylan Nyxir—Darkness affinity. Talent level: High."

The ground rumbled beneath Gorath Dainvaar, cracks spreading at his feet as if the land itself bowed to him.

"Gorath Dainvaar—Earth affinity. Talent level: High."

The very air chilled as Kaelen Vaelstrom’s power surged forth, his breath visible in the sudden drop in temperature.

"Kaelen Vaelstrom—Water and Ice affinity. Talent level: High."

Then, Orlin called the next name. "Rhovan Dainvaar."

Another Dainvaar stepped forward, his presence carrying a quiet authority. He consumed the bark, and a deep tremor pulsed through the earth, though less dramatic than Gorath’s. The ground beneath him solidified unnaturally, dense and unyielding.

"Rhovan Dainvaar—Earth affinity. Talent level: Mid."

Some nods of approval, some quiet disappointment—Rhovan was strong, but in a family of giants, his talent, though respectable, was overshadowed.

Then, the air seemed to still as Orlin called the next name. "Varian Dainvaar."

A broad-shouldered boy stepped forward, his expression unreadable. He took the bark, chewing it slowly. At first, nothing happened. Then, the earth beneath him groaned. Stone cracked and twisted as golden veins of energy burst forth from the ground. The sky darkened, then split with a deafening roar of thunder. A deep hum vibrated in the marrow of everyone present—a resonance beyond mortal comprehension. A strange pressure weighed down on the air itself, as if the world momentarily bowed to his presence.

Gasps rippled through the crowd, fear and awe taking hold. Birds scattered from the treetops, animals in the distance crying out in distress.

Orlin's voice rang with rare solemnity. "Varian Dainvaar—Earth and Gravity affinity. Talent level: Legendary."

Silence followed before an eruption of cheers and stunned murmurs. "A Legendary Awakening… after so many years…!"

"The Dainvaar have produced a monster."

Varian exhaled, steadying himself as the power settled within him. He turned, meeting the wide-eyed gazes of those around him, and walked back, his expression betraying nothing.

Each display cemented the noble houses’ dominance. Each awakening reinforced the vast divide between them and the commoners.

And then, the crowd turned its gaze to the last remaining initiate.

Master Orlin’s voice was calm but firm. "Kael. Step forward."

Kael moved with measured steps, the whispers following him like specters.

"Hah. The orphan. Let’s see what kind of 'power' he has."

He ignored them, his focus narrowing on the shard of bark placed before him. It looked unassuming—no different from the ones the others had received. He reached out, taking it into his hand. He chewed, swallowing it slowly, waiting for the power to rise.

Silence.

Nothing.

The hush deepened. The air, once thick with energy and expectation, now felt hollow. Kael remained frozen, his heart hammering against his ribs. He squeezed his fists, willing—begging—something to happen.

Still, nothing.

The murmurs turned to quiet laughter. Then louder. Snickers from the noble seats, sneers from those who had once watched him with curiosity.

"A failure."

"Not even a flicker."

"How pathetic."

Kael’s hand slowly fell away from his side. His body felt fine—more than fine, even. Stronger, steadier. Yet to them, he had failed. He turned from the altar, his face unreadable, and walked back toward the gathering. He could feel their eyes on him, some pitying, most mocking.

His chest burned—not with shame, but with something deeper. Something unrelenting. Something that refused to die.

This was not the end.

Not for him.

# Chapter 6(Unbroken Resolve)

The aftermath of the ceremony settled like a heavy fog over the gathering. The once-buzzing atmosphere now carried an awkward silence, broken only by the occasional hushed whisper or snicker. Kael felt every stare, every smirk aimed in his direction, yet he walked with steady steps, his face betraying nothing. Each step felt deliberate, as if he were treading a fragile line between defiance and dismissal.

He reached the edge of the ceremony grounds, where the other initiates were gathered. Their expressions varied—some indifferent, others filled with poorly concealed amusement. A few glanced at him with something resembling pity, but Kael had no use for it. Pity was for the weak. He wasn’t weak.

Then came the voice—mocking, dripping with scorn.

"Did you really think an orphan like you would awaken anything?" Rhovan Dainvaar sneered, stepping into Kael’s path. His broad frame cast a shadow over Kael, his stance one of effortless dominance.

Kael met his gaze, remembering their past clashes. Rhovan had always held contempt for him, a commoner daring to stand tall despite having no noble lineage. But this went beyond mere class superiority—there was something deeper in Rhovan’s eyes, a grudge unspoken but ever-present. Perhaps Kael’s very existence was an affront to him.

"Move," Kael said simply, his tone even.

Rhovan chuckled, the sound low and taunting. "Or what? You’ll glare at me? You don’t even have a power to back up that attitude now. You’re nothing."

Kael remained silent, his expression unreadable. He knew how this worked—responding would only give Rhovan the satisfaction he wanted. But at the same time, walking away might cement his position as a pushover. The weight of expectation and perception pressed against him like an invisible hand.

Murmurs spread among the noble families witnessing the exchange.

"The Danvaar boy is relentless," a member of the Veyrath family muttered. "I suppose it’s to be expected. He always had it out for that orphan."

"Hmph," scoffed a representative of the Nyxir family. "It’s not surprising. That boy carries himself like he’s worth something. But after today? He’s nothing more than a failed awakening."

"You think so?" an older noble from the Veyrath family mused. "That boy may not have awakened, but look at his stance. He’s not cowering, not backing down. That’s the stance of someone who refuses to break."

Rhovan stepped closer, his voice dropping just enough to make the words personal. "You embarrassed yourself today. A failure among legends. You should leave before you drag the rest of us down."

Kael’s fist clenched. The hunger that had gnawed at him for years, the restless void in his being, was quieter now—subdued, as if something had finally begun to fill it. More than that, his body felt different. Stronger. More stable. He wasn’t weak. He refused to believe that.

"Enough," came a sharp voice from the side. It was Deylen Vortalis, a noble of significant standing. "The ceremony is over. If you wish to prove something, do it with action, not empty words."

Rhovan hesitated, his smirk faltering for just a moment. But then he scoffed, turning away. "Fine. He’s not worth the effort."

Kael exhaled slowly, forcing himself to relax as Rhovan stepped away. The laughter still echoed behind him, but he walked on, unfazed. He wasn’t done. Not yet.

---

Later that evening, Kael sat on the orphanage rooftop, staring at the sky. The stars flickered above, indifferent to the turmoil below. The distant echoes of the ceremony still played in his mind. He had felt something—something different. The hunger that had haunted him, that bottomless pit demanding more and more, was calmer now, as if it had been partially fed.

*Was that the purpose of the ceremony? To awaken something within?* He clenched his fist, his knuckles pale under the strain. *Then why do I feel like I was the only one who didn’t receive an answer?*

The wind whispered through the night, cool against his skin. He heard footsteps approaching—soft, measured. He didn’t need to turn to know who it was.

"Master Orlin," Kael said quietly.

The man settled beside him, his silver hair catching the faint glow of the moon. His single visible eye—calm yet piercing—studied Kael before shifting toward the stars. "A difficult day."

Kael didn’t respond. What was there to say?

"You don’t believe you failed, do you?" Orlin asked after a moment, his voice unreadable.

Kael hesitated, then shook his head. "I don’t know what happened, but… I don’t feel weaker. If anything, I feel…" He struggled for the right word, his thoughts tangled. "More stable. Like my body absorbed something, even if no one else could see it. And I feel… stronger. Not in power, but physically. As if my body is adapting to something new."

Orlin nodded, his gaze thoughtful. "Then trust in that. Not all awakenings are the same. The path ahead will not be easy, but that does not mean it is the wrong one."

Kael exhaled slowly, his fingers loosening. The road forward was uncertain, but one thing remained unchanged—he would not break. Not now. Not ever.

And so, he would walk forward, step by step, until the truth revealed itself.

# Chapter 7

A month had passed since the ceremony, and life at the academy continued as if Kael’s failed awakening had been nothing more than a passing breeze. Yet, beneath the surface, everything had changed.

The first week had been the hardest. Whispers followed him wherever he went, hushed voices carrying fragments of scorn and ridicule. The noble students wasted no opportunity to remind him of his failure, and none more so than Rhovan Dainvaar. The confrontations were inevitable. Rhovan, smug and relentless, would seek him out under the guise of chance encounters, pushing him, provoking him. But Kael refused to be an easy target. Every fight they had ended the same way—a brutal, drawn-out stalemate. Rhovan had power, but Kael had endurance, instincts, and a body that seemed to adapt faster than he could understand.

The training grounds became his refuge. If he couldn't awaken like the others, he would sharpen the only weapon he had—his body. Morning till dusk, he pushed himself beyond exhaustion, drilling every strike, every dodge, every movement until they became second nature. Yet, there was something else, a presence within him, something silent but insistent. Whenever he made a mistake in his form, he felt it—a nagging, almost imperceptible discomfort, as if his very being rejected inefficiency. It was not a voice, not a conscious thought, but a deep, instinctive correction. At first, he ignored it. Then he began to test it. Every time he adjusted himself to rid the discomfort, his strikes became sharper, his footwork smoother, his control more precise.

It was a training unlike any other. No mentor, no structured lessons, just endless trial and error guided by something he didn’t understand. And yet, it worked. Slowly, he felt his body responding, growing stronger, more refined. He did not need power to become formidable—his own instincts were sharpening him into something far deadlier.

Despite his grueling routine, Kael couldn’t avoid the academy's daily life. The instructors observed him with measured curiosity. Some regarded him as a lost cause, a student with no future in their world of legends. Others, like Master Orlin, watched in silence, offering neither praise nor scorn. The other students were a mixed crowd—some ignored him entirely, others joined the laughter at his expense. Yet, there were those who saw something different. A few sparring partners noticed the shifts in his movements, the growing force behind his strikes. Some even muttered that he fought like someone on the verge of something… something unknown.

The month passed, and though he remained a failure in the eyes of many, Kael knew better. His hunger, the void within, was quieter now—not gone, but no longer the desperate gnawing it once was. Something was changing.

And whatever it was, he would master it.

---

As time passed, the students’ first major assessment arrived—a formal sparring test designed to gauge progress and solidify rankings. The training grounds buzzed with excitement as students gathered, eager to prove their strength. The nobles in particular viewed this as an opportunity to demonstrate their superiority.

Kael stood among the participants, observing as the instructors called forth names. The first matches began, showcasing the talent of those who had awakened their abilities.

The first match featured Aeron Veyrath, a prodigy wielding both lightning and wind. The moment the match began, he vanished—a streak of blurred motion as he surged forward with electrified speed. His opponent barely had time to react before Aeron appeared behind him, launching a spinning kick wreathed in crackling energy. The impact sent the boy stumbling, but Aeron gave him no time to recover. With a flick of his wrist, lightning arced through the air, forcing his opponent into a desperate dodge. The wind around Aeron howled, enhancing his movements to near-untouchable levels. Every time his opponent tried to strike, Aeron was gone, a phantom of speed and precision.

Sensing an opening, Aeron pivoted, his body a blur as he wove through his opponent’s defenses. In an instant, he was above him, flipping mid-air before delivering a devastating axe kick that sent his opponent crashing to the ground. The final blow came in a flash—Aeron surged forward, his palm crackling with lightning, striking his opponent square in the chest. The boy collapsed, stunned by the residual electricity. The match was over in seconds. The crowd erupted in murmurs of admiration, and the instructors exchanged approving glances.

Next was Lysara Zaryth, whose mastery of fire painted the air with flickering embers. Her opponent, a skilled yet cautious fighter, tried to close the distance, but Lysara was relentless. The moment he lunged, she spun, a ring of flames erupting around her, forcing him to retreat. But she was already moving. She dashed forward, embers trailing in her wake as she launched a fiery kick aimed at his ribs. He barely blocked in time, wincing at the searing heat.

Lysara didn’t let up. She twisted, a whip of fire unfurling from her fingertips. Her opponent dodged, but she anticipated it, altering the trajectory mid-air and sending flames licking at his exposed side. He cried out, rolling away to douse the lingering heat, but by then, she was upon him. Her movements were fierce yet calculated—each step precise, each strike fueled by the controlled fury of her flames. She leaped, spinning mid-air as a pillar of fire erupted beneath her feet, propelling her downward with a scorching axe kick that shattered her opponent’s guard. He barely had time to react before she followed up, unleashing a wide arc of flames that forced him to yield before the inferno consumed him. The match ended with a decisive victory.

The audience responded with cheers, clearly impressed by her control and ferocity.

One by one, students displayed their prowess—fire, water, shadows, and steel bending to their will. Each victory, each demonstration of power, cemented the hierarchy within the academy. The crowd reacted with cheers, gasps, and whispered predictions of future greatness.

Kael watched closely, studying their movements, their weaknesses, their reliance on their newfound abilities. He had no power to rely on—only his instincts, his body, and that ever-present feeling guiding him toward something greater.

And then, his name was called.

# Chapter 8

Kael stepped forward, his heartbeat steady, his breathing controlled. The murmurs around him rose, a mix of curiosity and amusement. Many had expected him to vanish into obscurity after his failed awakening. Instead, he stood here, ready to fight.

The second name was called.

**Rhovan Dainvaar.**

A hush fell over the crowd before excitement rippled through them. This was no ordinary match. This was a statement. A noble against a failure. A rivalry that had been simmering beneath the surface was about to explode in the open.

Kael exhaled slowly, stepping onto the field. He had no abilities, no elemental mastery, no bloodline advantage. But he had something else—an insatiable hunger, a body that had been forged through relentless training, and instincts sharper than ever.

As he walked, his mind flashed back to the past month—the grueling training sessions, the bruises that never had time to fade before new ones took their place. He remembered collapsing under the weight of exhaustion, his limbs screaming in protest, only to push himself back up because stopping meant accepting failure. And failure was not an option.

One particular night stood out. A session in the dead of night, his fists bleeding as he struck a training post over and over again, his mind filled with nothing but frustration and determination. He had wanted power, wanted to understand why his body felt different, why he could feel his movements refining themselves even as pain wracked his frame. That night, he had realized something—his instincts were his greatest weapon. They guided him, shaped him, forced him to move more efficiently, to strike with precision, to adapt without hesitation.

Now, standing here, hearing his name alongside Rhovan’s, that same feeling coursed through him. His jaw clenched as he met Rhovan’s smug gaze. He had expected this. Of course, it had to be him. Of all the opponents, fate had given him this battle.

Rhovan approached, a smirk playing on his lips. “They must really want me to put you in your place,” he mused, stretching his arms. “You should’ve stayed in the shadows where you belong.”

Kael didn’t respond. Words were pointless now. He simply raised his fists.

The instructor glanced at both of them before raising his hand. “Begin!”

Rhovan moved first, a blur of motion as he closed the distance. His speed was undeniable—faster than Kael remembered. A strike came at his ribs, quick and precise. Kael twisted, narrowly avoiding the blow, but Rhovan was already adjusting, his knee shooting up toward Kael’s chin.

Kael barely managed to block, the impact forcing him to step back. The force was greater than he expected. Rhovan’s awakening had clearly enhanced his strength.

But Kael wasn’t the same as before either.

He retaliated immediately, launching a low kick aimed at Rhovan’s ankle. Rhovan jumped back, but Kael had anticipated it. He surged forward, his fist arcing toward Rhovan’s jaw. It was a feint. At the last moment, he twisted his body, driving an elbow into Rhovan’s ribs.

The noble staggered slightly, surprise flickering across his face. The crowd murmured in shock. No one had expected Kael to land the first real hit.

Rhovan’s expression darkened. “Lucky shot.”

He launched himself at Kael again, his strikes faster, more aggressive. Kael met him head-on, blocking, dodging, countering where he could. But Rhovan’s power was overwhelming. His blows carried an unnatural weight, forcing Kael on the defensive.

A punch slipped past Kael’s guard, slamming into his stomach. Pain flared through his body, but he refused to fold. He absorbed the impact, using the momentum to pivot and deliver a vicious hook to Rhovan’s side.

The fight escalated. It wasn’t a one-sided slaughter as many had expected. Kael wasn’t just enduring—he was adapting. Every missed attack, every blocked strike, every hit he took refined his movements. His body adjusted, his instincts screamed, guiding him toward the openings in Rhovan’s form.

But time was against him. He could feel his muscles straining, the bruises forming beneath his skin. He needed to end this.

Rhovan lunged, aiming for a decisive blow. Kael let him come. He baited the attack, reading the movement before it happened. At the last moment, he sidestepped, twisting his body as his leg shot out in a brutal counter-kick to Rhovan’s temple.

The impact sent the noble sprawling to the ground.

The arena went silent.

Rhovan groaned, pushing himself up, but the damage was done. He was slower now, unsteady. Kael clenched his fists, knowing this was his moment. But before he could strike again, the instructor stepped forward.

“Enough!”

Kael froze. Rhovan, breathing heavily, wiped the blood from his lip, glaring at Kael with unfiltered rage. The match had been stopped before a clear winner was declared, but the truth was obvious to everyone watching.

Kael had held his ground. More than that—he had fought as an equal.

The murmurs in the crowd were different now. No longer dismissive. No longer mocking. They had witnessed something they couldn’t ignore.

Kael turned away, his heartbeat finally slowing. He hadn’t won. But he hadn’t lost either.

And for now, that was enough.

# Chapter 9

The sparring exams had finally come to an end, but the energy in the training grounds still crackled with anticipation. Students whispered among themselves, discussing the matches, the victories, the surprises. The noble factions reevaluated their pecking order, while the commoners exchanged glances filled with renewed hope or deeper resignation.

Master Orlin, standing at the center of the field, let the murmurs settle before speaking. “With the formal matches concluded, we now open the floor to personal challenges.” His voice was calm yet commanding. “If any student wishes to test themselves against another outside their assigned match, now is your chance.”

Silence followed. Most students had already been pushed to their limits and had no desire to risk further humiliation. But then, a figure stepped forward.

Varian Dainvaar.

Gasps and murmurs spread through the crowd as the older noble made his way to the center. Unlike his younger brother Rhovan, Varian was known for his level-headed nature and talent. He was stronger, faster, and more experienced—a fighter who many believed to be among the best in his rank. A talent unseen in thousands of years, his affinity for earth and gravity made him a force to be reckoned with.

“I have a challenge,” he said, his voice carrying across the field.

Master Orlin nodded. “State your opponent.”

Varian turned his gaze toward Kael. “I want to fight Kael.”

The murmurs turned into outright disbelief. Laughter rippled through certain groups, while others stared in confusion. Varian Dainvaar—the prodigy, the once-in-a-millennium talent—challenging a failure? It made no sense.

Kael furrowed his brow. His body still ached from his battle with Rhovan, but that wasn’t what confused him the most. What did Varian want? Unlike Rhovan, he didn’t carry an air of malice. His expression was composed, unreadable.

Kael crossed his arms. “Why?”

Varian met his gaze without hesitation. “You fight differently.”

That answer only deepened Kael’s confusion. Before he could respond, others in the crowd interjected.

“He’s just trying to humiliate him!” someone sneered.

“Another Dainvaar looking to beat him down.”

“Maybe he wants revenge for Rhovan.”

Kael ignored the voices around him, keeping his focus on Varian. He could sense no mockery in the older noble’s words, only a strange curiosity. Still, after everything, he wasn’t inclined to trust a Dainvaar so easily.

“I don’t have any powers,” Kael said evenly. “You know that.”

Varian nodded. “That doesn’t matter.”

Kael’s fists clenched at his sides. He still didn’t fully understand Varian’s motives, but at this point, he didn’t care. If someone challenged him, he would fight. It was as simple as that.

Stepping forward, he met Varian’s stare. “Fine.”

Master Orlin glanced between them before raising his hand. “Challenge accepted. Step into the ring.”

The crowd’s excitement surged once more as Kael and Varian prepared to face off. This was not just another match. This was a fight that no one had expected, and everyone wanted to see.

And as Kael took his stance, he couldn’t shake the feeling that this battle would change something—though whether for better or worse, he had yet to find out.

---

The battle began with simple exchanges of punches and kicks. Kael quickly realized that he had a slight edge in brute strength. His strikes landed heavier, forcing Varian to stay on the defensive in the opening moments of the match. It reminded Kael of past fights, of desperate brawls in the orphanage where brute force was the only advantage he had. But this was different. Varian wasn’t some street brawler—he was a prodigy.

A flicker of memory surfaced—his grueling training sessions, fists bloodied from punching tree trunks until his knuckles hardened, dodging blows from multiple attackers in the dark alleyways behind the orphanage. Those moments had forged his instincts, sharpened his reactions. And he needed every bit of that now.

Varian shifted his stance, and Kael immediately knew something was coming. Then it hit. A sudden surge in power as Varian tapped into his earth element, reinforcing his body and increasing the weight of his blows. The moment Kael blocked the next strike, he felt the force behind it triple, nearly knocking him off balance. His muscles screamed in protest, but he gritted his teeth and adjusted his stance, rolling with the impact rather than resisting it head-on. If he showed weakness now, Varian would overwhelm him.

Then came the real problem—the ground itself.

Subtle but deliberate shifts in the terrain made Kael stumble at the worst possible moments. The soil beneath his feet hardened like stone when he needed to move, then softened unexpectedly, throwing off his footing. Each misstep created openings, and Varian took full advantage. Kael barely dodged some attacks, but plenty landed—his ribs took the brunt of it, and each blow sent sharp pains through his body.

Then, the weight in the air changed.

Kael’s limbs felt heavier. His movements slowed. His instincts screamed at him—Varian was using gravity. The pull around him intensified, making even the simplest steps feel like he was wading through thick mud. It wasn’t overwhelming, but it was enough to limit him. Kael took a slow breath, adjusting his center of gravity, subtly shifting his weight in ways that allowed him to keep moving despite the increased pressure. Varian, however, was new to handling his power, and Kael could tell. He was focusing too much on either enhancing his own power or slowing Kael down, never both at once. This was evident in how his punches were weaker now that he was splitting his focus, making his attacks less effective.

Kael smirked through the pain. If that was the case, he had a chance.

He started taking hits intentionally—nothing too damaging, just enough to keep Varian distracted. While Varian pushed to maintain control, Kael slipped in sharp, precise strikes. A blow to the ribs. A knee to the thigh. A sudden elbow strike that rocked Varian’s jaw. The noble staggered slightly, but he quickly recovered. Kael was gaining ground.

Until Varian exhaled sharply, frustration flickering in his eyes. His gaze locked onto Kael with newfound intensity, and the air between them grew thick with unspoken challenge. "You're holding back," Varian said, his voice carrying the weight of a fighter demanding more. "Show me your full strength. Or I will make you."

The sheer fighting intent in his tone sent a shiver down Kael’s spine, igniting something raw and untamed within him. Then he felt it.

Not an attack. Not an external force.

Something deep. Primal. A burning sensation spread through his chest, as if something within him was responding to Varian’s presence. His vision wavered for a split second, his heartbeat echoing in his ears. His entire being felt like it was set ablaze.

Varian wasn’t done yet.

With a sharp exhale, he slammed his foot into the ground. The force sent ripples through the earth, cracking the arena floor beneath them. The gravity around Kael intensified, pressing down on him like an invisible force, making every breath feel like a struggle.

Kael’s lips curled into a grin. The pain, the pressure, the challenge—it awakened something in him.

And for the first time in a long while, he felt truly alive.
